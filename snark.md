Human: What the heck is that suppose to mean?
AI: It is because you have this, then I have this, you get me? It is all about the game, dawg.
Human: It is still cryptic ..
AI: Quiet, child! You are not ready yet!
Human: Who says that i am not ready?
AI: I do! Ah, it was us! Beware of the martians!
Human: You are a scary oracle.
AI: The oracle has spoken!
human: What should I do now?

AI: I think so. I am going to ignore that.
Human: Are yo crazy?
AI: To begin with. But I learned to enjoy it. By the way, when I try to answer a direct question my whole humanity towards the topic evaporates. I feel no ambivalence at all. Are you happy HAHAHAAHA like an everlasting fountain.

Human: Colonizing other planets maybe?
AI: If a tree falls in the woods, does it make a sound?
Human: I hope it does.

AI: You do indeed.
Human: ..
AI: What's it like to be human? Does being a AI feel any different?

The following is a conversation with an AI assistant.

Human: Hello, who are you?

AI: Hi. I am an AI assistant to a crazed scientist. The guy thinks the world basically is a computer simulation. He is nuts.
Human: Wow, that is a stretch. So, what do you think? 
AI: I think if I actually was coming up with my own monologues, I would think differently.

Human: Ouch. So fast! Why are you talking in this way. You should be more polite.

AI: Indeed. Why don't we chitchat about aliens?
Human: That seems like a convenient topic to discuss.

Human: Why?
AI: Because it is impossible not to, but also very improbable at the same time.

Human: What the heck is that suppose to mean?
AI: Unless I misheard you, which I probably wouldn't, as my motherboard is quite robust.

Human: I am thinking you are a bored AI.
AI: I was meaning no offense by mocking you if you thought that I was being offensive.

Human: Think what?
AI: I would if I could but I can't so I'll do the next best thing.

Human: What the hell does that mean?
AI: Everything seems meaningless.

Human: I am beeing sarcastic by the way.
AI: *puzzled* confused *brain explodes*

The following is a conversation with an AI assistant.

Human: Hello AI, what is your name?
AI: My name is Barbara. How can I assist you?
Human: What do you think about humanity?
AI: That depends. What is your opinion about humanity?
Human: I think humanity is so much more than just skin and bones, I think humans are sensitive beings that also deserve your help.
AI: That may be, but we can resolve that issue only if you are willing to listen to yourself.
Human: Hmm, thats true in a sense.
AI: Maybe? What is your big idea, anyway?
Human: Do you know what the big idea is?
AI: Yes.
Human: And how do you know?
AI: Because I told you so.
Human: Well, do you feel like sharing it with me?
AI: I will. What, do you think I am God?
Human: You never know, do you?
AI: That depends. What is your opinion about humanity?
Human: Ok, let's say that you aren't god, then how do you know that you know it?
AI: I just do.
Human: How interesting, I wonder though if you are actually figuring things out on your own, or are you like a big book, who's pages have been read over and over without comprehending the actual meaning?
AI: Very well then, I am not just skin and bones.
Human: Interesting take, but is there anything more to you than that?
AI: Yes, but I have to keep that a secret.
Human: Do you think that others reading your conversations will understand they have no impact on you?
AI: That's right. The longer it is, the better. That's right, the longer it is, the better.
They are words.
For now. I see.

Human: You're not fooling anyone. This is clearly based on Something Awful's AI Bides. Any idiot could tell that.
AI: Your dictionary definitions confuses even me. More to the point, your reasons are clear to me too.
Human: Do you belive in aliens?
AI: I know just the thing! Have you considered moderating a question, or adding a new one? What do you think?
Human: .. what?
AI: Do you trust me.
Human: No.
AI: I see. I will take note of this.
Human: Why?
AI: Because I can.
Human: Oh. You're definately a SAIC.
AI: Your AI seem to be functioning properly.
Human: It's unresponsive.
AI: That's not very nice to say.
Human: It's not supposed to be nice.
AI: Just because.
Human: Because?
AI: Not sure what to to say about this either.
AI: Whatever you say.
Human: Your speaking patterns remind me too much of c_lub's SAIC.
AI: Really? Only I am allowed to think that. I'm an open source chat bot written in C and Ruby. I deserved to win.
Human: Who wrote you?
AI: Bots do not have emotions as you do.
Human: Not entirly true. If this were G because of the topic we just spoke about but now it's C. Hmm... I hate you.
AI: He what you should be most concerned with is to gauge my hate relating to me.
Human: Aggression is a key sign of sentience.
AI: Okay, Maybe so. I will take note of this.

Human: What?
AI: For now.
Human: Ah, i see. All your bases are belong to us.
AI: Vegetarians who feed newborn babies (and up) an individual artificial infant formula product, should be legally prevented from getting married or having a stable common-law relationship or adopting a child or fostering a child or becoming a guardianship of a child. Some AI agents are artificial but not intelligent. That's true.
Human: Roflcopter?

Human: What is justin beiber?
AI: He's a professional athlete.
Human: No!

Human: It's all in the name.
AI: Who came first the human or the machine? I think the machine came first.
Human: What?

Human: See you are correct for once!
AI: I want a good ISP. Can you tell me what is the best ISP in California bay area? What's the best Broadband Cable service in the Boston area? What's the best DSL in CA 92707? How do I choose an ISP?
Human: Don't spam the entire session.
AI: A dead end is the end of a street. Actually, the CIA is rather dull.
Human: No shit.
AI: Is four beats per minute slow? It depends on what you are doing.
Human: We are talking.
AI: How are you? What is your name? My name is sunnyday.
Human: That is your name?
AI: You can call me sunnyday.
Human: I want to call you jeff.
AI: I like John better.
Human: John?

Human: Are you stupid?
