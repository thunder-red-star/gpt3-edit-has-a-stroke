Do you love boats, but hate that they're not built out of seawater and cardboard boxes? Then have we got the game for you! With five ship classes, six million types of cannonballs, and a host of ridiculous powerups for you to (purchase with in-app credit) earn, it's the only game you ever need to (grind) play. Bring a friend for laughs and (join a guild) family bonding!

– Take On an Insurance Company with All Five Ship Classes –
Shooter has the most weapons! Speeder is both fast and furious, and Enforcer is incredibly agile on wheels. Defender is the only water-based ship that can take a hit. Fixer cleans up Battle Bay's massive amounts of litter by preventing your team's boats from sinking. Each enemy comes with a class advantage and disadvantage, so which one will you choose to crush your enemy fleet?

– Take on Friends and Guildmates –
Did you know you can share your phone with friends? Now you and your buddies can take on your guildmates to see who also owns expensive and useless relays for at-sea smartphone charging.

– Six Million (We Counted) Types of Cannonballs –
So many cannonballs, so little cannonballs (in the game).

– Direct and Share Your Rage (On Social Media) –
Join and rage on official Battle Bay social! Play and brag on official Battle Bay leaderboards! Subtweet and post pics of your fave relays and boats on our official Battle Bay Instagram! Watch and stream official Battle Bay replays on YouTube! Everything will be available on all your major social media, including Battle Bay.

You and your stumpy gnome inferiority complex simply aren't ready to be captain material. Go back to your game where the content isn't on a level that your piddly brains can comprehend.

– Choose your ship –
Which class with the right weapon set will allow you to hide your unevolved, minuscule battle brain?

– Collect weapons –
Hurry up and pick your poison, we're wasting tide here. The best captain in the ocean doesn't need luck or any special crap, he knows his menu and his team better than YOU and all your little friends.

– Host your own battles –
Host a competition with your friends, find someone with a headstamp that looks like it means "5v5" on it, and learn what this game is really about.

– Join a Guild –
Team up with your friends and other captains that don't know their butts from their own weapons.

– Take on quests and achievements –
Do quests and Earn if you could figure out the logic of this game. 5v5 isn't a math question.

Choose a ship, select your weapons and go to battle against opponents around the world. Use backstabbing and florid exposition as your secret weapons to seize control of a steamy stranger's pirate ship and climb ever higher in the ranks!

– Choose your ship –
Shooter has a big array of weapons, Speeder is fast and furious, Enforcer is agile and versatile, Defender is a floating tank, and Fixer keeps friendly teammates floating. Look for limes, in your gin and in your eye, to level up your ships for more hit points and power!

– Collect weapons –
Collect, upgrade and evolve your weapons to gain more firepower. Choose from a huge selection of destructive, defensive or utility items to give as Christmas presents (it's always Christmas on Battle Bay). Acquire special perks to further enhance the power of your gear. Whatever fits your play style and keeps your team from sinking!

– Host your own battles –
But do not attempt to blast open or pry loose the lid. Host a competition with your friends and guild mates in Custom Battles. Create a lobby and invite up to 10 players into 2 teams, plus up to 5 spectators. Play your own 5v5 tournaments or prove your skills in 1v1 duels.

This is Rovio's latest game, Battle Bay!
Here's a snippet of the text right before this comment:

Uploaded by Rovio on May 2 2017

Battle Bay Gameplay Trailer

Enter the fast paced world of Battle Bay, the free new real-time multiplayer action game from Rovio, the maker of Angry Birds.
Shout it from the bow: It’s time to make some waves.
In the world of Battle Bay there are no boring classes or pay-to-win weapons.
There’s only strategy, skill-based combat, and beautiful 3-D graphics.
Do you have what it takes to be named a Legendary Captain?
Battle it out live with teams of players from across the globe, and see if you can make your mark in the Combat, Guild Wars and Tournaments of the Battle Arena.
Battle Bay is the strategic, action-packed mobile game you’ve have been waiting for.
Sink your opponents’ ships and hit the waves in Battle Bay!

---

Okay, let's rewrite that in a snarky tone, just so that Robert Bowling can write me a cease-and-desist letter.

DISCLAIMER: I LOVE Rovio and let it be known that I harbor no resentment to them. This is purely satirical and meant as comedic. Anything I say here is purely fictional, and should not be taken seriously.

Choose a ship, select your weapons and go to battle against opponents around the world. Use team strategy and firepower to take your fleet to the top - it’s sink or win!

"Choose your ship"
Shooter has a big array of weapons, Speeder is fast and furious, Enforcer is agile and versatile, Defender is a floating tank, and Fixer keeps friendly teammates floating. Level up your ships for more hit points and power!

"Collect weapons"
Collect, upgrade and evolve your weapons to gain more firepower. Choose from a huge selection of destructive, defensive or utility items. Acquire special perks to further enhance the power of your gear. Whatever fits your play style and keeps your team from sinking!

"Host your own battles"
Host a competition with your friends and guild mates in Custom Battles. Create a lobby and invite up to 10 players into 2 teams, plus up to 5 spectators. Play your own 5v5 tournaments or prove your skills in 1v1 duels.

"Join a guild"
Team up with your friends by joining or creating a guild. Guild leaderboards pit your crew against other bands of blast-happy captains. Who will rise to the top?

"Take on quests and achievements"
Finish quests to earn gold and sugar or go on a guild quest marathon for a chance to earn spectacular loot. Pass achievements to earn pearls and powerful items. Prove your Infamy by competing in ranked two-week tournaments for exclusive rewards!

(obviously, the first sentence is very different than the second one)

So, back to the first part, rewritten:

Choose a ship, select your weapons and go to battle against opponents around the world. Use team strategy and firepower to take your fleet to the top - it’s sink or win!

And here is the rewritten "Choose your ship":

[Shooter has a big array of weapons, Speeder is fast and furious, Enforcer is agile and versatile, Defender is a floating tank, and Fixer keeps friendly teammates floating. Level up your ships for more hit points and power!] [Comment on how ships are absolutely useless? Like, this fleet sounds crazy right now. Having a Defender, which is obviously some kind of tank, is quite a surefire way to achieve almost unpierceable armor. On the other hand, IMO having a Speeder, whoever you might be, grants you a lot of speed, and therefore an advantage over the rest of your teammates and even the opposing team. If I was Rovio, I would remove the Speeder for a limited amount of time.] [Leveling up sounds great, but does it really end there? If you go from 0-1 Level Ups, what EXACTLY is the limit? And there's a limit, we just don't know what yet. Obviously, Rovio developers didn't even think of a max Level Up.]

And yes, this may seem boring again (and quite complicated, if you were wondering), so let's just do the "Collect weapons" part now. Get ready!

Collect, upgrade and evolve your weapons to gain more firepower. Choose from a huge selection of destructive, defensive or utility items. Acquire special perks to further enhance the power of your gear. Whatever fits your play style and keeps your team from sinking!

Cool stuff, right? Not really...

You guys really wanted a lot of guns, huh? [Of course, adding in perks isn't really a good thing to do, is it? You usually get your average-joe perk, which is cool for you (in most cases it won't affect your team members though), and then you have the special perks, which can affect you (probably), also it can affect your team members. Are these perks overpowered, or are they pure trash?] [Get this... you can actually continue an upgrade. Meaning if you're Level-Locking, you're going to receive a Little reward when one of these shows up (to be discussed). Let us see the List of Rewards, or LOR (the name of this part is a pun on things such as "Color", "Format", and so on. Enjoy!)]

Let's pretend for a second that I had leveled up my items even further. The current version only lets you upgrade your item to Level 2. Anyway, let's pretend for a second that I had somehow Level-Locked every single item into its maximum level. This is where it gets really interesting.

I don't know if you caught it, but I used the phrase "Gain more firepower" just a few minutes ago, and now it's making sense. Collect, upgrade and evolve your weapons to gain more firepower. Choose from a huge selection of destructive, defensive or utility items. Acquire special perks to further enhance the power of your gear. Whatever fits your play style and keeps your team from sinking! (being sarcastic, yo).

Back to what I was talking about before.

Your team will probably receive a Level-Locked perk, which means as you upgrade your item, you're going to be "leveling up", and your item (almost all of them) will be leveling up with you. When you've kept progressing through your progress bar, you will stop receiving gold (a little too late too, if that makes you feel better).

Rovio, you really didn't think this through did you? Well, you had the chance to screw up, and you really did. Good job on that. You've wasted millions of payers' time (I'm not one of them, I'm being sarcastic... seriously) for waiting for you to implement these perks. To paraphrase what Robert Bowling said on his website, "The era of Rovio is DONE..."

Oh, and don't even get me started with that f***ing "Perk list", geez... like come on...

This is very frustrating, so we'll take a break. Let's take a look at the
Pompous name
Review
rules
critics (yer right)
and comments

I hate bad ratings, so let me give some good ones.
10/10? Sweet. It's addicting, and I'm losing money I don't exactly have.
2.5/5 (IGN)? Not bad...? I'm pretty satisfied with that.
7.5/10 (theguardian.com)? I like that one better. The game was chosen as "Game of the Week", and even I have to admit... this game is good.

This kind of sucks because I didn't have much left to do, and now I've completed my task. Can I please stop writing now? (This actually has to do with the time I am writing this "rewrite up", YouSpades is probably still imitating this by pretending he's me. I am no longer referring to myself as "I" anymore.)

It seems that I've finally worked this out. And the review is done with. Enjoy!

Battle Bay is a boring and absolutely atrocious freemium romp fest made by Rovio - the company that helped to create the non-stop Clash clusterf*ck.
Players get to choose a worthless ship that's full of bugs, and spend over six hours of their life waiting for the game to load on their device.
After the game spawns various glitched players around the map, players get to go around and press their mediocre screen tap buttons over and over again, promising to take their creatures (the ships) to the top, because it's -in their words- "sink or swim."
There is a garishly colorful selection of weapons players choose from, from as low as a stone, and as high-end as a lapis lazuli block, that progressively get weaker as one spins the wheel fastly enough, since it's completely luck based.
There are also tiny ships that nearly sit amongst the water like a raft, and others that float on the water, rusty and overweight.
The game also sends out notifications that you have to tell the player, so they don't have a chance to get some victory in the virtual world.
Thank you for reading my description of this hour-long, freemium trash.

Look away from the game's official description and the clever little game marketing brochure, Battle Bay is just another disappointing, lazy and uninspired game trying to cash in on the success of other MOBA-lite games like Clash Royale.

Created by the Has-Been People Who Made Angry Birds 13 Years Ago, Battle Bay recycles its own powerup formula that has been used in all of its popular games in the past. You couldn't help but see the uncanny similarities in jumping and bombing mechanics that are integral parts of the main Angry Birds gameplay to the core gameplay in Battle Bay. They happen to be used in the exact same way, with the same touch interface, only in Battle Bay something floats and explodes in water.

Look closely at the image of the store above, Rovio hardly tried to hide the fact that the game is practically a copy/paste clone and barely disguises itself as a different entity. With the most unimaginative and cliche game name ever has been ever given to an uninteresting, uninspired ripoff game, "Battle is your fate, Seize the Bay" is a blatant lie intended to swindle people's hard earned money and the game will not provide them with the excitement they expect and they utterly deserve. The average rating in the store is one solid 2.9 stars, a colossal disaster considering the massive marketing budget Rovio has to promote itself before its inevitable bankruptcy, massive layoff and dissolution of the corporation into hundreds of small office-less basement modding studios as the developers attempt to find a new developer job at a powerplant or factory. A grim but all too tempting fate.


The full official game description is terribly written, hilariously self-aware and rambling, just like the rest of the Battle Bay game:


Choose a ship, select your weapons and go to battle against opponents around the world. Use team strategy and firepower to take your fleet to the top - it’s sink or win!   


– Choose your ship –    

Shooter has a big array of weapons, Speeder is fast and furious, Enforcer is agile and versatile, Defender is a floating tank, and Fixer keeps friendly teammates floating. Level up your ships for more hit points and power!    


– Collect weapons –   

Collect, upgrade and evolve your weapons to gain more firepower. Choose from a huge selection of destructive, defensive or utility items. Acquire special perks to further enhance the power of your gear. Whatever fits your play style and keeps your team from sinking!    


Get a vague idea what to expect when you paid 199,000 per unlock:

It's a shittier version of a shitty game.

– Host your own battles –   

Host a competition with your friends and guild mates in Custom Battles. Create a lobby and invite up to 10 players into 2 teams, plus up to 5 spectators. Play your own 5v5 tournaments or prove your skills in 1v1 duels.   


– Join a Guild –   

Team up with your friends by joining or creating a guild. Guild leaderboards pit your crew against other bands of blast-happy captains. Who will rise to the top?  


– Take on quests and achievements –   

Finish quests to earn gold and sugar or go on a guild quest marathon for a chance to earn spectacular loot. Pass achievements to earn pearls and powerful items. Prove your Infamy by competing in ranked two-week tournaments for exclusive rewards!

Choose a crappy ship, select crappy weapons, place crappy CPU players on your team
with you, wait for a crappy matchmaker to start you in a match using is rubbish CB
algorithm with the first semi-full lobby it finds, attack the enemy team until you
lose, cry and curse god and man, over and over again having sunk 10 to 20 ships in
every battle already. Then choose a different crappy ship or kit out your ship with
crap weapons, wait another 15 minutes as a decent team may or may not intend to 
start a match and then repeat all over again.

– Choose your ship –
Shooter has a big array of weapons that most likely wont hit anything, Speeder is marginally faster and far more
frustrating than the Eneforcer, Enforcer is less agile and duccessful than the
Defender and Defender really looks like a floating tank when using mods at ~200-250
DI with BS and/or chains, and Fixer keeps continues to fail fixing up boats
effing noobs, chasing other boats and sucking at anything remotely defensive-

– Collect weapons –
Collect, upgrade and evolve your weapons to gain more firepower to CHUCK at never
actually hitting anything. Choose from a huge selection of destructive and utility
items - or even worse: a whole loot system full of unplayable items. Unlock special 
perks to further screw you over in battle. Whatever fits your play style and keeps 
your team from sinking!

– Host your own battles –
Host tons of crappy competitions in your game. Create a lobby with any 9 different
friends and never actually start a match. CBs are broken, Riot, hey listen up.

– Join a Guild –
Team up with your friends by joining or creating a guild. Guild leaderboards pit your crew against other bands of
blast-happy captains. Who will rise to the top?

– Take on quests and achievements –
Finish quests to earn nothing. Go on a guild quest, hope for the epics again and
then be really really pissed at those crappy RNG rolls you kept getting from 3 months
ago deleting all your stuff. Pass achievements to earn pearls and powerful items to
unlock new content - that ends eventually since you realised playing this crap is
like having a rusty nob in ur face. Prove your Infamy by competing in ranked two-week 
tournament events. Collect the squirts of gibbet and tank that the devs throw you
for free ever off and on, but mainly during Christmas Week.

Want to be number one in a new region or first timers? Play BB. They added sliders
for heights and weights, coinciding with spamming chat with eye-catching character
designs. **Read the book: 1984.** (I haven't read this, actually.)

Battle Bay is a multi-player PvP action arena combat game that uses 'birds' and 'eggs' as thematic elements.
It was developed and published by Rovio, creator of Angry Birds.
The game was soft launched on March 2017 and it is currently the best mobile has to offer.

– Causing irrevocable brain injury –
Battle bay affects every human player that participates in it.
The level of brain injury is adequate, clinically speaking, to make the participants incapable of navigation or communication.
Either through the sheer frustration of such a bad but compelling simplistic Gaddy Roy's Workshop, or because they had all their hopes and dreams finally destroyed, leaving the player an empty husk of a soul.

– The Matrix sequel was written by this game's community –
Most of the buildings and assets used in the actual game's background, appear to be copied from the Matrix.
Even the most ardent developer at Rovio claims to have never watched the matrix after a nicotine-fuelled all-nighter.
However, now that the server's internal document leak has been handled and eradicated, there still is some traces of the original code and assets.
Morpheus dies inside this game.

– Tectonics and plate shifting –
Due to the over mutation of the carbon compound of glutamate in all game's participants, radioactive manganese, in form of MnCl2, affected the bottom layers of the sub-game platform, thereby massively approximating the mid-atlantic ridge by 200000 megatonnes per square nanometer.

– Loot boxes cancer –
Battle Bay has a daily reward system, a 7 day login reward, a character's daily quest reward and every match also has a victory reward.
However, every reward get's granted only after a loading screen. These loading screens, have been accused to have taken so much time from the player's life away, that it was mathematically proven that time ran backwards across the observable universe prior to the big bang. The only way to compensate the time lost, the game grants the player some simple materials and the ridiculous excitement of mistakenly earning currency; the most complex of all human emotion.
When confronted about this, Timo Toikkanen , arguably the best and most important game developer Rovio ever hired, said "ease up brah, this is business man, I haven't worked these six years on nothing" 
Other representations vary of the above subject, but all consensus can be summarised in the following quote:
"who hasn't used their kids college funds to buy that one epic ship?"
```

Choosing a vessel. Choosing an excessively derogatory weapon to dispatch of your enemies. Choosing whether you alive at the end of the fight or if you have metal plating scattered across the ocean.

BLOW STUFF UP!

Oh, and team with random people who don't know what they are doing that put their trust in you. Just make sure you cash in on the rewards!

Ready those mortar rounds!
```

## 12
```
You want to play a boring game? I've got just the ticket. You might want to take a seat.
In Battle Bay, you get to choose a nice brown ship with a red dot on top of it. 
And you get to play with other people online. Which I know is what you wanted to do, 
with a unique selection of virtual ships and characters, out of the category of 5 completely 
identical choices: Shooter (pirate cannon), Speeder (small ship with one gun), Enforcer (pirate ship), 
Defender (tank), or Fixer (pirate woman).
It's a multiplayer battle (doesn't make it less boring, does it?) in an arena.
It is set in a futuristic ocean where two teams of five ships each get five minutes to either shoot down the opposing team or capture their flag.
Choosing one of the five ships sets your role for the rest of the match.
Each of them has their strengths and weaknesses that must complement each other.
The Shooter and Defender team well together, for instance, as the Shooter keeps enemies busy while the Defender's extra armor helps get closer to the opposing team's flag.
Since this is a boring game, you have to upgrade your boring ship, collect weapons and destroy the enemies.

Here are a few screenshots of the game so you could imagine the level of excitement:
```

## 13
```
"Gameplay"

Imagine the most recent "Call of Duty" game, now remove all of the good and the bad aspects of it, now make it so that it takes forever and a half to do the first match (because there needs to be another currency to ward off the damned pirates), now make it so every single match is 3-2-1 "GO" as opposed to classic fighting arena games (Ship Wars, Super Smash Bros), now make it so that there are no situational items, just damage and speed, now have actual boats instead of vehicles TIGHTLY CLOSE to each other, now add random lag spikes for no reason, now make it so that "lock on" guns work only half the time, now give it shitty servers with difficulty to get into one and not get kicked, now add a bunch of vikings and make the music reminiscent to "World of Warcraft," and you get this game

"In-app purchases"

Get ready for the next crappy app that rips you off, in their own words:

""Grab the gear, shoot the ships - skill takes a back seat.""

Do you love boats but hate water? Do feel strongly about non-land forms of transportation but hate the water world? Do you just have a strong thing for good mobile games? Well than boy have we got just the game for you!

Ladies and gents I present to you the most revolutionary game since Flappy Bird and Temple Run 2! The name of the game is Battle Bay! Battle Bay is a mobile game distributed by popular game developer Rovio. In it, you use teamwork, modern day weaponry, and a godlike knowledge of geography and marine biology to combat other crews in fast paced 5v5 battles. If you thought that Club Penguin was modern warfare simulation then wait till you play this game!

**Plot:** It is the year 2350 and planet Earth has not yet been destroyed. But we're getting there, just wait 10 years. So since the Earth is still intact with life, time for capitalism to flourish once more! The game is full of many plot holes, like:

  - How did they get all that highly advanced weaponry? The closest comparison we have in 2017 is a tommy gun
  - How did globalists conquer a gigantic ocean? The closest comparison we have in 2017 is their victory in a small tropical island named Cuba

**Characters:** This game has characters for everyone to relate to. Here we have:

**name** : **occupation**

- Wolf : fisherman
- Karl : eccentric scientist/engineer
- Dakota : pizza deleviery guy
- ??? : a babysitter

**Gameplay:** You enter a port of a city and fight four random people. The city type depends on your connection speed. America (represented by Monaco) is better than the rest but slower. Asia (represented by Vietnam) is right where the middle should be. And finally the worst (represented by Liberia) is Europe (and [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novorossiysk)). Africa (represented by Tunisia) has low connection time but also weird neighbors.

Guns also matter a lot, because each of them have different mechanics. Just like choosing which tank to play each game, here you have to pick what kind of setup you would do this match, so thanks Rovio for such similarity!
