Do you love boats, but hate that they're not built out of seawater and cardboard boxes? Then have we got the game for you! With five ship classes, six million types of cannonballs, and a host of ridiculous powerups for you to (purchase with in-app credit) earn, it's the only game you ever need to (grind) play. Bring a friend for laughs and (join a guild) family bonding!

– Take On an Insurance Company with All Five Ship Classes –
Shooter has the most weapons! Speeder is both fast and furious, and Enforcer is incredibly agile on wheels. Defender is the only water-based ship that can take a hit. Fixer cleans up Battle Bay's massive amounts of litter by preventing your team's boats from sinking. Each enemy comes with a class advantage and disadvantage, so which one will you choose to crush your enemy fleet?

– Take on Friends and Guildmates –
Did you know you can share your phone with friends? Now you and your buddies can take on your guildmates to see who also owns expensive and useless relays for at-sea smartphone charging.

– Six Million (We Counted) Types of Cannonballs –
So many cannonballs, so little cannonballs (in the game).

– Direct and Share Your Rage (On Social Media) –
Join and rage on official Battle Bay social! Play and brag on official Battle Bay leaderboards! Subtweet and post pics of your fave relays and boats on our official Battle Bay Instagram! Watch and stream official Battle Bay replays on YouTube! Everything will be available on all your major social media, including Battle Bay.

You and your stumpy gnome inferiority complex simply aren't ready to be captain material. Go back to your game where the content isn't on a level that your piddly brains can comprehend.

– Choose your ship –
Which class with the right weapon set will allow you to hide your unevolved, minuscule battle brain?

– Collect weapons –
Hurry up and pick your poison, we're wasting tide here. The best captain in the ocean doesn't need luck or any special crap, he knows his menu and his team better than YOU and all your little friends.

– Host your own battles –
Host a competition with your friends, find someone with a headstamp that looks like it means "5v5" on it, and learn what this game is really about.

– Join a Guild –
Team up with your friends and other captains that don't know their butts from their own weapons.

– Take on quests and achievements –
Do quests and Earn if you could figure out the logic of this game. 5v5 isn't a math question.

– Choose your ship –
Shooter has a big array of weapons, Speeder is fast and furious, Enforcer is agile and versatile, Defender is a floating tank, and Fixer keeps friendly teammates floating. Look for limes, in your gin and in your eye, to level up your ships for more hit points and power!

Collect, upgrade and evolve your weapons to gain more firepower. Choose from a huge selection of destructive, defensive or utility items to give as Christmas presents (it's always Christmas on Battle Bay). Acquire special perks to further enhance the power of your gear. Whatever fits your play style and keeps your team from sinking!

This is Rovio's latest game, Battle Bay!
Here's a snippet of the text right before this comment:

Uploaded by Rovio on May 2 2017

Battle Bay Gameplay Trailer

Enter the fast paced world of Battle Bay, the free new real-time multiplayer action game from Rovio, the maker of Angry Birds.
Shout it from the bow: It’s time to make some waves.
In the world of Battle Bay there are no boring classes or pay-to-win weapons.
There’s only strategy, skill-based combat, and beautiful 3-D graphics.
Do you have what it takes to be named a Legendary Captain?
Battle it out live with teams of players from across the globe, and see if you can make your mark in the Combat, Guild Wars and Tournaments of the Battle Arena.
Battle Bay is the strategic, action-packed mobile game you’ve have been waiting for.
Sink your opponents’ ships and hit the waves in Battle Bay!

---

Okay, let's rewrite that in a snarky tone, just so that Robert Bowling can write me a cease-and-desist letter.

DISCLAIMER: I LOVE Rovio and let it be known that I harbor no resentment to them. This is purely satirical and meant as comedic. Anything I say here is purely fictional, and should not be taken seriously.

Choose a ship, select your weapons and go to battle against opponents around the world. Use team strategy and firepower to take your fleet to the top - it’s sink or win!

"Choose your ship"
Shooter has a big array of weapons, Speeder is fast and furious, Enforcer is agile and versatile, Defender is a floating tank, and Fixer keeps friendly teammates floating. Level up your ships for more hit points and power!

"Collect weapons"
Collect, upgrade and evolve your weapons to gain more firepower. Choose from a huge selection of destructive, defensive or utility items. Acquire special perks to further enhance the power of your gear. Whatever fits your play style and keeps your team from sinking!

"Host your own battles"
Host a competition with your friends and guild mates in Custom Battles. Create a lobby and invite up to 10 players into 2 teams, plus up to 5 spectators. Play your own 5v5 tournaments or prove your skills in 1v1 duels.

"Join a guild"
Team up with your friends by joining or creating a guild. Guild leaderboards pit your crew against other bands of blast-happy captains. Who will rise to the top?

"Take on quests and achievements"
Finish quests to earn gold and sugar or go on a guild quest marathon for a chance to earn spectacular loot. Pass achievements to earn pearls and powerful items. Prove your Infamy by competing in ranked two-week tournaments for exclusive rewards!

(obviously, the first sentence is very different than the second one)

So, back to the first part, rewritten:

Choose a ship, select your weapons and go to battle against opponents around the world. Use team strategy and firepower to take your fleet to the top - it’s sink or win!

And here is the rewritten "Choose your ship":

[Shooter has a big array of weapons, Speeder is fast and furious, Enforcer is agile and versatile, Defender is a floating tank, and Fixer keeps friendly teammates floating. Level up your ships for more hit points and power!] [Comment on how ships are absolutely useless? Like, this fleet sounds crazy right now. Having a Defender, which is obviously some kind of tank, is quite a surefire way to achieve almost unpierceable armor. On the other hand, IMO having a Speeder, whoever you might be, grants you a lot of speed, and therefore an advantage over the rest of your teammates and even the opposing team. If I was Rovio, I would remove the Speeder for a limited amount of time.] [Leveling up sounds great, but does it really end there? If you go from 0-1 Level Ups, what EXACTLY is the limit? And there's a limit, we just don't know what yet. Obviously, Rovio developers didn't even think of a max Level Up.]

And yes, this may seem boring again (and quite complicated, if you were wondering), so let's just do the "Collect weapons" part now. Get ready!

Collect, upgrade and evolve your weapons to gain more firepower. Choose from a huge selection of destructive, defensive or utility items. Acquire special perks to further enhance the power of your gear. Whatever fits your play style and keeps your team from sinking!

Cool stuff, right? Not really...

You guys really wanted a lot of guns, huh? [Of course, adding in perks isn't really a good thing to do, is it? You usually get your average-joe perk, which is cool for you (in most cases it won't affect your team members though), and then you have the special perks, which can affect you (probably), also it can affect your team members. Are these perks overpowered, or are they pure trash?] [Get this... you can actually continue an upgrade. Meaning if you're Level-Locking, you're going to receive a Little reward when one of these shows up (to be discussed). Let us see the List of Rewards, or LOR (the name of this part is a pun on things such as "Color", "Format", and so on. Enjoy!)]

Let's pretend for a second that I had leveled up my items even further. The current version only lets you upgrade your item to Level 2. Anyway, let's pretend for a second that I had somehow Level-Locked every single item into its maximum level. This is where it gets really interesting.

I don't know if you caught it, but I used the phrase "Gain more firepower" just a few minutes ago, and now it's making sense. Collect, upgrade and evolve your weapons to gain more firepower. Choose from a huge selection of destructive, defensive or utility items. Acquire special perks to further enhance the power of your gear. Whatever fits your play style and keeps your team from sinking! (being sarcastic, yo).

Back to what I was talking about before.

Your team will probably receive a Level-Locked perk, which means as you upgrade your item, you're going to be "leveling up", and your item (almost all of them) will be leveling up with you. When you've kept progressing through your progress bar, you will stop receiving gold (a little too late too, if that makes you feel better).

Rovio, you really didn't think this through did you? Well, you had the chance to screw up, and you really did. Good job on that. You've wasted millions of payers' time (I'm not one of them, I'm being sarcastic... seriously) for waiting for you to implement these perks. To paraphrase what Robert Bowling said on his website, "The era of Rovio is DONE..."

Oh, and don't even get me started with that f***ing "Perk list", geez... like come on...

This is very frustrating, so we'll take a break. Let's take a look at the
Pompous name
Review
rules
critics (yer right)
and comments

I hate bad ratings, so let me give some good ones.
10/10? Sweet. It's addicting, and I'm losing money I don't exactly have.
2.5/5 (IGN)? Not bad...? I'm pretty satisfied with that.
7.5/10 (theguardian.com)? I like that one better. The game was chosen as "Game of the Week", and even I have to admit... this game is good.

This kind of sucks because I didn't have much left to do, and now I've completed my task. Can I please stop writing now? (This actually has to do with the time I am writing this "rewrite up", YouSpades is probably still imitating this by pretending he's me. I am no longer referring to myself as "I" anymore.)

It seems that I've finally worked this out. And the review is done with. Enjoy!

Battle Bay is a boring and absolutely atrocious freemium romp fest made by Rovio - the company that helped to create the non-stop Clash clusterf*ck.
Players get to choose a worthless ship that's full of bugs, and spend over six hours of their life waiting for the game to load on their device.
After the game spawns various glitched players around the map, players get to go around and press their mediocre screen tap buttons over and over again, promising to take their creatures (the ships) to the top, because it's -in their words- "sink or swim."
There is a garishly colorful selection of weapons players choose from, from as low as a stone, and as high-end as a lapis lazuli block, that progressively get weaker as one spins the wheel fastly enough, since it's completely luck based.
There are also tiny ships that nearly sit amongst the water like a raft, and others that float on the water, rusty and overweight.
The game also sends out notifications that you have to tell the player, so they don't have a chance to get some victory in the virtual world.
Thank you for reading my description of this hour-long, freemium trash.

Look away from the game's official description and the clever little game marketing brochure, Battle Bay is just another disappointing, lazy and uninspired game trying to cash in on the success of other MOBA-lite games like Clash Royale.

Created by the Has-Been People Who Made Angry Birds 13 Years Ago, Battle Bay recycles its own powerup formula that has been used in all of its popular games in the past. You couldn't help but see the uncanny similarities in jumping and bombing mechanics that are integral parts of the main Angry Birds gameplay to the core gameplay in Battle Bay. They happen to be used in the exact same way, with the same touch interface, only in Battle Bay something floats and explodes in water.

Look closely at the image of the store above, Rovio hardly tried to hide the fact that the game is practically a copy/paste clone and barely disguises itself as a different entity. With the most unimaginative and cliche game name ever has been ever given to an uninteresting, uninspired ripoff game, "Battle is your fate, Seize the Bay" is a blatant lie intended to swindle people's hard earned money and the game will not provide them with the excitement they expect and they utterly deserve. The average rating in the store is one solid 2.9 stars, a colossal disaster considering the massive marketing budget Rovio has to promote itself before its inevitable bankruptcy, massive layoff and dissolution of the corporation into hundreds of small office-less basement modding studios as the developers attempt to find a new developer job at a powerplant or factory. A grim but all too tempting fate.


The full official game description is terribly written, hilariously self-aware and rambling, just like the rest of the Battle Bay game:


Choose a ship, select your weapons and go to battle against opponents around the world. Use team strategy and firepower to take your fleet to the top - it’s sink or win!   


– Choose your ship –    

Shooter has a big array of weapons, Speeder is fast and furious, Enforcer is agile and versatile, Defender is a floating tank, and Fixer keeps friendly teammates floating. Level up your ships for more hit points and power!    


– Collect weapons –   

Collect, upgrade and evolve your weapons to gain more firepower. Choose from a huge selection of destructive, defensive or utility items. Acquire special perks to further enhance the power of your gear. Whatever fits your play style and keeps your team from sinking!    


Get a vague idea what to expect when you paid 199,000 per unlock:

It's a shittier version of a shitty game.

– Host your own battles –   

Host a competition with your friends and guild mates in Custom Battles. Create a lobby and invite up to 10 players into 2 teams, plus up to 5 spectators. Play your own 5v5 tournaments or prove your skills in 1v1 duels.   


– Join a Guild –   

Team up with your friends by joining or creating a guild. Guild leaderboards pit your crew against other bands of blast-happy captains. Who will rise to the top?  


– Take on quests and achievements –   

Finish quests to earn gold and sugar or go on a guild quest marathon for a chance to earn spectacular loot. Pass achievements to earn pearls and powerful items. Prove your Infamy by competing in ranked two-week tournaments for exclusive rewards!

Choose a crappy ship, select crappy weapons, place crappy CPU players on your team
with you, wait for a crappy matchmaker to start you in a match using is rubbish CB
algorithm with the first semi-full lobby it finds, attack the enemy team until you
lose, cry and curse god and man, over and over again having sunk 10 to 20 ships in
every battle already. Then choose a different crappy ship or kit out your ship with
crap weapons, wait another 15 minutes as a decent team may or may not intend to 
start a match and then repeat all over again.

– Choose your ship –
Shooter has a big array of weapons that most likely wont hit anything, Speeder is marginally faster and far more
frustrating than the Eneforcer, Enforcer is less agile and duccessful than the
Defender and Defender really looks like a floating tank when using mods at ~200-250
DI with BS and/or chains, and Fixer keeps continues to fail fixing up boats
effing noobs, chasing other boats and sucking at anything remotely defensive-

– Collect weapons –
Collect, upgrade and evolve your weapons to gain more firepower to CHUCK at never
actually hitting anything. Choose from a huge selection of destructive and utility
items - or even worse: a whole loot system full of unplayable items. Unlock special 
perks to further screw you over in battle. Whatever fits your play style and keeps 
your team from sinking!

– Host your own battles –
Host tons of crappy competitions in your game. Create a lobby with any 9 different
friends and never actually start a match. CBs are broken, Riot, hey listen up.

– Join a Guild –
Team up with your friends by joining or creating a guild. Guild leaderboards pit your crew against other bands of
blast-happy captains. Who will rise to the top?

– Take on quests and achievements –
Finish quests to earn nothing. Go on a guild quest, hope for the epics again and
then be really really pissed at those crappy RNG rolls you kept getting from 3 months
ago deleting all your stuff. Pass achievements to earn pearls and powerful items to
unlock new content - that ends eventually since you realised playing this crap is
like having a rusty nob in ur face. Prove your Infamy by competing in ranked two-week 
tournament events. Collect the squirts of gibbet and tank that the devs throw you
for free ever off and on, but mainly during Christmas Week.

Want to be number one in a new region or first timers? Play BB. They added sliders
for heights and weights, coinciding with spamming chat with eye-catching character
designs. **Read the book: 1984.** (I haven't read this, actually.)

Battle Bay is a multi-player PvP action arena combat game that uses 'birds' and 'eggs' as thematic elements.
It was developed and published by Rovio, creator of Angry Birds.
The game was soft launched on March 2017 and it is currently the best mobile has to offer.

– Causing irrevocable brain injury –
Battle bay affects every human player that participates in it.
The level of brain injury is adequate, clinically speaking, to make the participants incapable of navigation or communication.
Either through the sheer frustration of such a bad but compelling simplistic Gaddy Roy's Workshop, or because they had all their hopes and dreams finally destroyed, leaving the player an empty husk of a soul.

– The Matrix sequel was written by this game's community –
Most of the buildings and assets used in the actual game's background, appear to be copied from the Matrix.
Even the most ardent developer at Rovio claims to have never watched the matrix after a nicotine-fuelled all-nighter.
However, now that the server's internal document leak has been handled and eradicated, there still is some traces of the original code and assets.
Morpheus dies inside this game.

– Tectonics and plate shifting –
Due to the over mutation of the carbon compound of glutamate in all game's participants, radioactive manganese, in form of MnCl2, affected the bottom layers of the sub-game platform, thereby massively approximating the mid-atlantic ridge by 200000 megatonnes per square nanometer.

– Loot boxes cancer –
Battle Bay has a daily reward system, a 7 day login reward, a character's daily quest reward and every match also has a victory reward.
However, every reward get's granted only after a loading screen. These loading screens, have been accused to have taken so much time from the player's life away, that it was mathematically proven that time ran backwards across the observable universe prior to the big bang. The only way to compensate the time lost, the game grants the player some simple materials and the ridiculous excitement of mistakenly earning currency; the most complex of all human emotion.
When confronted about this, Timo Toikkanen , arguably the best and most important game developer Rovio ever hired, said "ease up brah, this is business man, I haven't worked these six years on nothing" 
Other representations vary of the above subject, but all consensus can be summarised in the following quote:
"who hasn't used their kids college funds to buy that one epic ship?"
```

```
Choosing a vessel. Choosing an excessively derogatory weapon to dispatch of your enemies. Choosing whether you alive at the end of the fight or if you have metal plating scattered across the ocean.

BLOW STUFF UP!

Oh, and team with random people who don't know what they are doing that put their trust in you. Just make sure you cash in on the rewards!

Ready those mortar rounds!
```

## 12
```
You want to play a boring game? I've got just the ticket. You might want to take a seat.
In Battle Bay, you get to choose a nice brown ship with a red dot on top of it. 
And you get to play with other people online. Which I know is what you wanted to do, 
with a unique selection of virtual ships and characters, out of the category of 5 completely 
identical choices: Shooter (pirate cannon), Speeder (small ship with one gun), Enforcer (pirate ship), 
Defender (tank), or Fixer (pirate woman).
It's a multiplayer battle (doesn't make it less boring, does it?) in an arena.
It is set in a futuristic ocean where two teams of five ships each get five minutes to either shoot down the opposing team or capture their flag.
Choosing one of the five ships sets your role for the rest of the match.
Each of them has their strengths and weaknesses that must complement each other.
The Shooter and Defender team well together, for instance, as the Shooter keeps enemies busy while the Defender's extra armor helps get closer to the opposing team's flag.
Since this is a boring game, you have to upgrade your boring ship, collect weapons and destroy the enemies.

Here are a few screenshots of the game so you could imagine the level of excitement:
```

## 13
```
"Gameplay"

Imagine the most recent "Call of Duty" game, now remove all of the good and the bad aspects of it, now make it so that it takes forever and a half to do the first match (because there needs to be another currency to ward off the damned pirates), now make it so every single match is 3-2-1 "GO" as opposed to classic fighting arena games (Ship Wars, Super Smash Bros), now make it so that there are no situational items, just damage and speed, now have actual boats instead of vehicles TIGHTLY CLOSE to each other, now add random lag spikes for no reason, now make it so that "lock on" guns work only half the time, now give it shitty servers with difficulty to get into one and not get kicked, now add a bunch of vikings and make the music reminiscent to "World of Warcraft," and you get this game

"In-app purchases"

Get ready for the next crappy app that rips you off, in their own words:

""Grab the gear, shoot the ships - skill takes a back seat.""

Do you love boats but hate water? Do feel strongly about non-land forms of transportation but hate the water world? Do you just have a strong thing for good mobile games? Well than boy have we got just the game for you!

Ladies and gents I present to you the most revolutionary game since Flappy Bird and Temple Run 2! The name of the game is Battle Bay! Battle Bay is a mobile game distributed by popular game developer Rovio. In it, you use teamwork, modern day weaponry, and a godlike knowledge of geography and marine biology to combat other crews in fast paced 5v5 battles. If you thought that Club Penguin was modern warfare simulation then wait till you play this game!

**Plot:** It is the year 2350 and planet Earth has not yet been destroyed. But we're getting there, just wait 10 years. So since the Earth is still intact with life, time for capitalism to flourish once more! The game is full of many plot holes, like:

  - How did they get all that highly advanced weaponry? The closest comparison we have in 2017 is a tommy gun
  - How did globalists conquer a gigantic ocean? The closest comparison we have in 2017 is their victory in a small tropical island named Cuba

**Characters:** This game has characters for everyone to relate to. Here we have:

**name** : **occupation**

- Wolf : fisherman
- Karl : eccentric scientist/engineer
- Dakota : pizza deleviery guy
- ??? : a babysitter

**Gameplay:** You enter a port of a city and fight four random people. The city type depends on your connection speed. America (represented by Monaco) is better than the rest but slower. Asia (represented by Vietnam) is right where the middle should be. And finally the worst (represented by Liberia) is Europe (and [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novorossiysk)). Africa (represented by Tunisia) has low connection time but also weird neighbors.

Guns also matter a lot, because each of them have different mechanics. Just like choosing which tank to play each game, here you have to pick what kind of setup you would do this match, so thanks Rovio for such similarity!

Battle Bay is a combat-like game developed by Rovio Entertainment, the company that brought you addictive little puzzle game Angry Birds.
Contrary to Angry Birds, Battle Bay does not involve any birds, or pigs for that matter.
Instead, it has ships and a lot of weapons.
Since it is made by the same company that made Angry Birds, it is "free", but it really is not; why do you think this game has so many ads everywhere?
Anyway, the whole point of the game [read : ways to waste your time] is to fight against other players around the world.
I find that the matching algorithms did not done so well, but if you play 5v5, you could get a defenceless little boat that stays most of the time in the back of the team, and when I was but very few level, one of my teammates was 55 in level, so that one could not fight against you and I because we were so low-leveled.
Why am I even wasting my time writing this?
I guess if you do not have an mmo shooter, then a very slow, frustrating and 5v5 waterproof board game that the maker and whatever supports are not even playing and probably does not even have the game installed on their phone.
Yeah, maybe that game is probably just for watching ads.
*shrug*

From the maker's website:
CHOOSE YOUR SHIP
Shooter has a big array of weapons, Speeder is fast and furious, Enforcer is agile and versatile, Defender is a floating tank, and Fixer can repair friendly ships. Level up your vessel for more hitpoints and power!
COLLECT WEAPONS
Collect, upgrade and evolve your weapons to gain more firepower. Choose from a huge selection of destructive, defensive and utility items. Add items like shields, speed boosts, mines and smoke bombs to even the odds. Whatever fits your playstyle and keeps your team from sinking!
Both: positive things; balanced?
Which one is better?
Farmer- I know they will trick you into buying pearls!
Follow the auto-balance, why do not you?
Me- Wow, thanks.
*Dead silence*
Maybe Farmbot is still on his way out of this hell to Mongolia...
Does your "Play over WIFI or 4G" mean that I would have to pay extra for data transmission if I do not have Wi-Fi?
It would show us who to sink every time, no?
Good: anybody can develop an AR game!
Nothing means that you are not going to pay or anything?
In my world, they would say that it would eventually be a premium currency, but it is not called that.
Brrrr!!
Sounds like a frozen country of penguins!
Or could it be a war-torn country of penguins?
In my universe, "Farmbot" has no rights to be a robot made to handle screwdrivers because it is man-made!
What would you get if you took away the game mechanics and call it a freeware game?
One thing, and one important thing in particular: a paid game without money.
If you get 8000 HP plow, your main weapon deals 196-249 damage per second.
And from the looks of it, there are even more of those useless ones, they did not even put those items into the wallpaper!
I would not be surprised if one day, the makers behind the next "Pokemon" would be these trolls.
Junny: that is a good idea, but it would not; the new system would just make a second tier of untradable ones.
If you want your battles to count, then you need to play ladder mode.
Battle bay by Rovio entertainment is not a good way to sell things: it is just a few words taken from ancient peoples; it draws people in to show them everything but the real thing and when that fails, whoever is still there, gets a strange sad feeling...

Battle Bay is a 5-player PvP game where players choose a ship, select a weapon, and go to battle against other skilled players like yourself. Sure, it looks like it's a beginner's MOBA, and even sounds like a beginner's MOBA, but in reality - it's probably much easier than League of Legends or Dota 2.  That's right, if you're looking for a MOBA that requires no effort, minimum practice or forethought, or an understanding of how timing, balls and brains actually work, this is the game for you.
Players will choose one of five ships including the Enforcer, Defender, Shooter, Fixer, or Speeder.  Each ship - get this - has different capabilities.  Using team strategy, fire power, and inborn pwnage skills, you will need to help your fleet win.  If you don't, then you have failed and will have to play again.

There are many levels and in those levels, you can collect power ups, weapons and the like.  If you're bored at the office, you can use some of the power ups and weapons to blast your fellow employees by shooting spitballs or throwing a mushed banana at them.  And, when you collect a Gold reward or sugar level, you can segue into being Batman on a sugar rush, dismissing people by crumbling sugar balls while they choke on the dust.  Ah!  Good times!  (It's rumored that the dust is ground up copies of The Recount or the Oakland Tribune or something.)

Register for your own game and it becomes pleasing to have "my" day with friends and family.  We don't have a lot of money to share, we don't have much time to spend with friends because those friends are already entangled in the tanks, we got less bodies each year, and family not with us.  We do my best.  I do what I wish to please God and take care of my loved ones.  I know a number of our friends are excited about this and I share the excitement.

Will we does sufficient to prepare for the enemy and for the upcoming storm?  No.  Some enemies you can not prepare for.  Some storms you can not prepare for.  Fear is a trap to such men but we can prepare our hearts and minds in ways that we do not let the pressure of those situations define us.

We focus on doing business with the world, we concentrate on presenting our product, and we make my best.  Please take a brief look at our story and video of the game today and get back to me with your thoughts.
Battle Bay is the best simulator of its kind.


– Collect weapons –
Collect, upgrade and evolve your weapons to gain more firepower. Choose from a huge selection of destructive, defensive or utility items. Acquire special perks to further enhance the power of your gear. Whatever fits your play style and keeps your team from sinking!

Imagine that you could go back in time.  Just go back and start off with the best program ever created.  What would you put into it?

A program that does not have to have any failures and does not have to have a bunch of worthless redundancy.  A program that does not have to be watched over by any human beings at all would be nice.

A program that works and you not need anyone sitting there watching to see if it goes off course or fails.

What would be the best sandbox simulator ever and how would you build it?

Battle Bay is the triumphant return to form by Angry Birds breadwinner Rovio, the small studio that could. After the small revolution they caused with the first Angry Birds, its predecessor Bad Piggies, and their plethora of spinoffs, there was really nowhere that Rovio could go but down. But with their ship battle game Battle Bay, Rovio has achieved what its team strove for for so many years: truly accurate water physics in a ship combat game, plus water battles where the water is orange.

Simple concept

In Battle Bay, you simply control a working ship while looking at the fair prospect at the ship in front of you, in your fifth and final match of the day. Your ship, with its agility and versatility, is an agile onrushing combat ship capable of putting three torpedoes in each of the other ships, or in fact an entire round of the entire magazine into their largest ships. Ships are custom-made, with handcrafted designed decks built consisting of finely tuned harpoons, a broadside of several meticulously explosive rounds, and a wonderfully tantalizing guided and timed blast of stunningly predictable damage. All this on a trusted and beloved platform. Our ship. Which does not move in a pattern that might ever be agreed on as curve worthy of the name. An absolute, 100% straight line, each and all of them. And the waters it sails upon are, of course, orange.

Conclusion

On your boat you blew up another boat, congratulations! It was not an R/C boat, or designed as a toy. It was however designed in clunky chibi-esque fashion that obscures the large amount of texture and detail the developers have lovingly crafted into each weapon in your arsenal, whose small lightning stuns that you hit the other players with are incredibly vivid and a spectacle it warms the heart to behold. But it was not a toy for that. It was a deed of joy, and accomplishment with no equal within this plane of existence, that here in this cruel cruel place, you fought with the very soul of a ship, and while lacking in many parts of the game, has a small bit of good and well-crafted ship combat in it.

Choose a ship, select your weapons and go to battle against opponents around the world. Your primary mode of gameplay involves sitting in a room waiting for battle to begin. Use your team's lack of strategy, firepower, and minimal fighting skills to rise to the top of the mediocrity. Win or avoid becoming an meme!

Play solo, and discover how much you rather be playing Nintendo DSi games when you are ranked against Guilds with 5 active members. Then repeatedly quit the game, for no other purpose than to hide your account power of 132.

– Choose one of Rovio's Pirate Ships –
Shooter has a big array of weapons, Speeder is fast and furious, Enforcer is agile and versatile, Defender is a floating tank, and Fixer keeps friendly teammates floating. Level up your ships for more hit points and power!

– Collect weapons –
Collect, upgrade and evolve your weapons to gain more firepower. Choose from a huge selection of destructive, defensive or utility items. Acquire special perks to further enhance the power of your gear. Whatever fits your play style and keeps the other ships from reaching the goals before your own ship gets targeted by the majority of your less-than-stellar teammate's aim.

– Host your own battles –

Host a competition with your friends and guild mates in Custom Battles. Wait up to thirty minutes before the entire lobby gets bored and leaves. Create a lobby and dorks with up to 10 players into 2 groups of similar accounts, plus up to 10 more spectators. Play your own pseudo-single-player tournaments or get beat repeatedly in 1v1 duels.

– Join a Guild –
Team up with your friends lesser-than-average Rovio lovers by joining other people's guilds. Guild leaderboards pit your crew against other bands of blast-happy captains. Who will rise to the top? The answer is: very few.

– Take on quests and achievements –
Battle Bay has a grand total of 2 quests. One is "win 22 battles in this next 2 weeks". The other is "get 1000 resource points in the next 14 days". Both are super easy, and awards a total of 3,000Coins and 663 Sugar. Find other ways to spend your time, spending money on this low selling mobile game. Prove your Infamy by competing in ranked two-week tournaments for exclusive rewards, only to miss out completely on each opportunity for several tournaments in a row.

– The Rovio Rules –
Unless you are willing to dish out $20 every month for a VIP subscription, you're in for a rough ride. Without VIP, you're looking at an hour and a half per day just on login bonuses, 30 minutes a day just on PVP matches, and an hour's worth of daily tickets. If you are not holding a VIP subscription, minicaft is the only place to go if you don't have any true friends to spend 1.5 hours with daily.

Congrats! You made it to the bottom! Post your daily rants and memes here regarding Battle Bay!

Choose a ship, select your weapons and go to squirt gun fight against opponents around the world. Protesting to the moderators about other ships' weapons is crucial for establishing a maritime victory for your team. The victorious team is the team that is both slightly less unscrupulous and a bit more skilled (or even mere blind luck - victory is a crap shoot after all).

– Choose your ship –
There are five ships, each with their own pros and cons. The Shooter has an array of offensive weaponry, the Speeder is fast and furious. The Enforcer has a spear gun, the Defender puts on a bottle of water jets and mows down would-be attackers with unbreachable titanics and water balloons, and the Fixer keeps friendly teammates floating. Level up your ships for more hit points and power!

– Collect weapons –
Collect, upgrade and embrace the utter foolishness of your inability to marshal the cannons or deploy a shield or repair your ship to keep yourself from sinking in a squirt gun fight against other 11 year olds. While at first you start with a simple, unassuming water pistol, as you get more money, you can upgrade to a bigger gun - a rocket launcher! ...ZOOM! While the water gun's range isn't impressive, the rocket launcher's range is REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY LONG! (but even with the finest strategy and team play, your ship's position at spawn always ends up pulling you down into the jaws of the streamline monsters...the odd-numbered squares)

Rovio's motto is that there is no right way to play Battle Bay because ending up in an unlucky position outweighs any skill or strategy earned in previous rounds. "Skill" and "Strategy" does not enter into the contest because every decision you can make could be a fatal one based on respawn and spawn square configuration which you cannot possibly predict.

– Host your own battles –
If you are pro enough to wait for hours a day to finally obtain a streamer. But prepare to be betrayed - because your spawn square position could suck you into an unhealthy relationship where you think they're on your side before quickly being let down repeatedly until you decide to sit that one out and pay to feel better. It's an addictive experience, so players return again and again...just like gas station sushi.

– Join a Guild –
Twenty-five year old men can go hog-wild with each other over who won or lost in a battle. They're together with their friends, but not like together together 'cus that would be gay. You see, online friendships provide a safe refuge for real-life relationships with family and friends - so it's probably in a lonely dude's best interest to hide behind a screen and criticize other players.

– Take on quests and achievements –
Finish a quest series to earn consumable items like food and weapon upgrades. If you are pro enough to be a part of a guild, you might stumble upon something (probably nothing) in a guild quest but you're more likely to develop anal cancer from surfing the fuck youtube ad-tech. Prove your Infamy by being a dumb ass one-trick pony by competing in ranked two-week tournaments for exclusive rewards! ...that can be acquired from random loot boxes or as guild rewards!
