Do you love boats, but hate that they're not built out of seawater and cardboard boxes? Then have we got the game for you! With five ship classes, six million types of cannonballs, and a host of ridiculous powerups for you to (purchase with in-app credit) earn, it's the only game you ever need to (grind) play. Bring a friend for laughs and (join a guild) family bonding!

– Take On an Insurance Company with All Five Ship Classes –
Shooter has the most weapons! Speeder is both fast and furious, and Enforcer is incredibly agile on wheels. Defender is the only water-based ship that can take a hit. Fixer cleans up Battle Bay's massive amounts of litter by preventing your team's boats from sinking. Each enemy comes with a class advantage and disadvantage, so which one will you choose to crush your enemy fleet?

– Take on Friends and Guildmates –
Did you know you can share your phone with friends? Now you and your buddies can take on your guildmates to see who also owns expensive and useless relays for at-sea smartphone charging.

– Six Million (We Counted) Types of Cannonballs –
So many cannonballs, so little cannonballs (in the game).

– Direct and Share Your Rage (On Social Media) –
Join and rage on official Battle Bay social! Play and brag on official Battle Bay leaderboards! Subtweet and post pics of your fave relays and boats on our official Battle Bay Instagram! Watch and stream official Battle Bay replays on YouTube! Everything will be available on all your major social media, including Battle Bay.

You and your stumpy gnome inferiority complex simply aren't ready to be captain material. Go back to your game where the content isn't on a level that your piddly brains can comprehend.

– Choose your ship –
Which class with the right weapon set will allow you to hide your unevolved, minuscule battle brain?

– Collect weapons –
Hurry up and pick your poison, we're wasting tide here. The best captain in the ocean doesn't need luck or any special crap, he knows his menu and his team better than YOU and all your little friends.

– Host your own battles –
Host a competition with your friends, find someone with a headstamp that looks like it means "5v5" on it, and learn what this game is really about.

– Join a Guild –
Team up with your friends and other captains that don't know their butts from their own weapons.

– Take on quests and achievements –
Do quests and Earn if you could figure out the logic of this game. 5v5 isn't a math question.
