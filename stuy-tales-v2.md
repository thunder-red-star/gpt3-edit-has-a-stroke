Most people imagine their high school experience as an aggregate of mindless homework and the occasional quiz, but Stuyvesant High School promised much more. Its high population of nerds gave it an almost unparalleled name. Its infamous graduation rate of 100% drew ambitious intellects from across neighborhoods. Its fierce competition, though daunting even to a curious eighth-grade hopeful, promised a fair, top-ranked education reinforcing the value of hard work.

Stuyvesant was a dream to me.

This particular opening, to the coveted-by-all freshman year, evoked less excitement and more stomach-churning anxiety than an episode of Breaking Bad. Lectures and guided notes would dominate the lesson. Undoubtedly, I would forget all about my messy house sitting at home, in the cluttered living room I had occupied for the entirety of my life until that point.

Despite his role as “head of the house,” I was more responsible than my father was, who never grasped the function of the humble pre-position. I had spent countless hours over the summer worrying and fantasizing about what to expect on my first day of high school. I was certain that my family's home was falling apart due to our financial disarray.

I ran to a librarian I hoped would be much more helpful. She directed me to a telephone number scribbled on a message pad hanging carelessly on a wall. A tired female voice, evidently used to fielding requests for years, greeted me and answered my all-too-common questions with practiced, calm words.

“No, you do not have to pay for the sticker in person from the libraries--you can get it from me.”
Her accent spoke of a home in the Caribbean islands, but I could not pinpoint the exact location.

“What? No, I can't.”

“Stuyvesant will be closed? But it's only five thirty.”

I would be required to circle the building the next morning before entering the high school--not an ideal way to spend a morning, but at least a privilege of being an early bird. If I demanded any further assistance, the woman on the other end of the telephone call told me gently, she would take no qualm in referring me to an administrative office.

“I need more assistance.”

All my efforts were quickly starting to feel like a huge waste of time. This was the last time I would have to brave this frightening ordeal on a rainy September morning at the beginning of a new school year, a process I would have to repeat approximately 6 miles away each morning, including Saturdays and Sundays. The lady's voice echoed from across the quad, relaxed yet repetitious, “Come with your phone, water, and umbrella and be safe out there.”

Despite the long trek through barren streets before dawn, I was happy. I now had a safe place to learn and take some time off from the daily struggles I faced. I had a refuge, a home away from home. At first, I could barely believe that this chance existed; it must be too good to be true.

It was.
