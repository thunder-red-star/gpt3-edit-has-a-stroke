Guild Name: Birds of Blasting
Guild Advertisement:
This is the guild of the birds! There are angry birds, just look below!
Rovio, the company that makes angry birds, was formed in 2003 and immediately started producing games. 
The game Angry Birds was released in 2009. 
The game is simple, just launch birds at pigs to reclaim the eggs. 
Just like in the game, our guild launches ourselves at people and allies to take over. 

Angry birds have become so popular over the years, millions of people have downloaded the games. 
For Halloween, Petrol and the NSA dressed up as the frightened piggies in their Fort! 
Because this game has become so popular, it was made into a movie that was released in 2016.
In the movie, there are Red, Chuck, Bomb, and other Angry Birds. The pigs, including King Leonard Mudbeard try to steal the eggs. 
Fortunately, the birds including Zeta saves the day.
Cat Sheera, who is a pink cat, appears in the Angry Birds Movie 2. 
This movie is funny because the birds outsmart the pigs and they destroy the two pigs fort.

Being in the guild of the angry birds, you will learn how to attack, plot, scheme, and hatch a clever plan in order to carry out the plot. 
You will also hatch your evil plot in order to defeat the people and allies, who don't want to hate pigs and egg thieving, of our guild. 
To be evil, follow the example of a pig in Angry Birds, funny because anti everything is to hate eggs. 
You don't have to be a cat to join this guild.

The worst kind of pig is a king pig, he casts a spell that makes an egg turn evil. 
The Dark Lord Leonard the Pig can use this to transform a person into an angry pig who uses an iron battle axe and rides an armored hog rider instead of being a superhero.
Using an evil egg will make you a pig and evil.
This event is similar evil magic that has turnt many people evil including Willie Loomis, Reverend Jesse Custer and Sebastian Moran. 
Casting a spell that transforms an egg or a person into an evil pig and using the evil way can turn people into a pig because birds hates pigs. 

People who are a fan of Angry Birds will fly to join this guild. There are eight birds and some people and allies hate eggs. 
An invisible fan of Angry Birds will the fourth!
If you love Angry Birds, and you have ever seen the movie, please join the guild of birds.
The codes of this guild are to hate eggs and pigs. 
To be in this guild, the fans or birds have to hate the egg abominations that Darrin Stephens uses. 
Fans of this guild, who use the same kind of magic seen on Bewitched, should avoid using the same kind of egg seen on there. 
We don't want to be like her because she chooses to use that magic. 

Please email your application here to be a bird in this guild. 
Also, you may join the guild by showing that you hate eggs, like when you use the same magic as Samantha Stephens on Bewitched, please avoid using that kind of magic. 
To use magic on yourself, let a bird shoot a missile at you.
Just don't let Samantha do it for you, because I know, if she does it for you, you'll be transformed into an evil Bewitched pig that casts iron battle axes at birds. To avoid this, don't ask Samantha to shoot a missile at you.

Angry Birds, Fly like an angry bird to this guild. 
In fact, to hatch the plot, fly like an angry bird to destroy Darrin Stephens house because Samantha loves eggs. 
So, don't ask her to shoot you so you will turn into a pig. 
Birds are a regular character on Clocks in this guild because birds can also stand on top of the clock.
