My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

Expand upon this idea, writing a paragraph or two. Make it more interesting as well – write a story, using descriptive language. Relate back to your own experiences hearing about Stuyvesant and wanting to be admitted.

I remember hearing about Stuyvesant High School when I was a young middle schooler.
I knew that it was the most prestigious, prestigious high school in New York.
While my friends were scrounging around the freshman high school fair, I walked straight
to the Stuyvesant High School booth. There, a cute, poofy-haired young man with a face so
white he looked unwholesome was helping attendees acquire information pamphlets. I asked 
him how I could, one day, become a student of Stuyvesant, a role model for middle schoolers
everywhere. He took my right hand in his left and looked straight into my eyes.
"The future is an open book with an unknown number of empty pages," I thought he said.
"Yessss, delicious," I replied.
"What was that?" I then heard him ask.
"I said, 'Yes, delicious.' What did you say?" I inquired.
He rolled his eyes. "Just study hard and get lucky, kid. It's a popularity contest," and
released one of my fingers to perform some other task I was unaware of, because I had turned
around and walked away in a huff.
