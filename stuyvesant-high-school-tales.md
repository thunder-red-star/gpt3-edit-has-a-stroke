I remember hearing about Stuyvesant High School when I was a young middle schooler.
I knew that it was the most prestigious, prestigious high school in New York.
While my friends were scrounging around the freshman high school fair, I walked straight
to the Stuyvesant High School booth. There, a cute, poofy-haired young man with a face so
white he looked unwholesome was helping attendees acquire information pamphlets. I asked 
him how I could, one day, become a student of Stuyvesant, a role model for middle schoolers
everywhere. He took my right hand in his left and looked straight into my eyes.
"The future is an open book with an unknown number of empty pages," I thought he said.
"Yessss, delicious," I replied.
"What was that?" I then heard him ask.
"I said, 'Yes, delicious.' What did you say?" I inquired.
He rolled his eyes. "Just study hard and get lucky, kid. It's a popularity contest," and
released one of my fingers to perform some other task I was unaware of, because I had turned
around and walked away in a huff.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

I remember staring at the school newspaper “The Spectator” as a 8th Grader in middle school
and admiring the bright lights of the city that were featured outside the classrooms on certain days.
I thought it was amazing how students could go through rigorous
courses while still finding a way to write articles and put together
high level media.
Little did I know that regular students also suffered through the
stress of the school just as much as I did; it was just that they found
a way to relieve it in a more productive manner.

High school is a bittersweet experience. In other words, there are some experiences which you do not wish to relive and
enjoy. I had heard that Stuyvesant High School was one of theoretically the best schools in New York, even the states.
My first experiences with the school system in New York was a disaster, since in the sixth grade, I had broken my
right leg from attempting to qualify for the Achilles Track Club. I had to miss a significant amount of time due to
the hospitalization, and so, I failed my sixth grade year, pushing me past my age at the time. Nonetheless, I attended
the Track Club, and was quite happy to do so.

One day, I thought to myself, "Wouldn't it be nice to attend one of New York's best high schools?" And so, I did the
programs, learned the tricks that were required in the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT). And eventually,
I was admitted to a school that I had only heard of. Welcome to Stuyvesant.

My freshman year, I felt like I was on top of the world. I was finally in Stuyvesant, the top public high school in New York City.

My PSAT score of 1954 had just been mailed home in a decorative envelope, stamped with a seal of approval from the College Board, stating that I was eligible for Commended recognition in recognition of my outstanding performance on the PSAT.

I was taking four AP classes: AP US History, AP English Language, AP Calculus BC, and AP Physics C. I'd had enough AP experience in middle school to feel confident passing them all.

I might have felt that feat envy towards the kids in my class taking 5 AP classes, but in my mind, increasing the academic rigor of classes by taking an additional AP class led to a net decrease in the amount one learned per unit of time. The stress would skyrocket, and test scores, which were the final culmination of learning for them, would plummet.

Or so I thought.

My sophomore year, I realized that I had little to actually boast about from my freshman year. 

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

When I was in 5th grade, I found a magnet on my refrigerator that had the word "Stuyvesant" printed on it. It had all of the names of the specialized NYC high schools. 

I had never heard of the school before, so I asked my parents what it was. My dad told me it was a very good school, in which only the smartest of kids were admitted.

I read the statistics that showed that unionized teachers at these high schools receive a salary of $160,000 a year. If they ever stopped being good at their job, it would be impossible to get rid of them. 

"That's amazing, being able to get a job that pays so well and is so secure", I thought. 

When I heard there was a 7th grade exam just for admissions, I immediately signed up for the test and started studying for months. 

Thankfully, I passed. In the 9th grade, I got off to a good start. 

However, as soon as I entered highschool, I realized that there were many things about our school that weren't as good as I had expected. 


The school was old and dirty; it looked exactly like the old electric power plants or water treatment facilities you see in the movies. The bathrooms had graffiti and that overpowering smell of adolescence. I couldn't really go to the bathroom after gym class, because they would be full of teenagers doing their own business. I went to a run down locker room where there were hardly any changing stalls and I changed my clothes in the bathroom stalls. 

In addition, the quality of the education needs improvement. 
In fact, I believe that bright kids at the top of their class at Bronx Science, Staten Island Technical High School, and even Brooklyn Tech would receive a significantly better education than most students at Stuyvesant. 

The school administration has been reluctant to fire badly performing teachers. Politically difficult decisions are left to the side. 

A better approach would be to model Stuyvesant High School after some of the best high schools in the country, such as Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, or even academic institutions like Harvey Mudd College, Georgetown University's MCV Campus, and Cooper Union. 

Even so, I appreciate the opportunities that Stuyvesant has given to me. However, I wish that the people at the school management level would think more clearly, and make the changes that need to be made.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

It was about two years ago when I first heard about this extraordinary school.
It was in an e-mail from a friend, who had a brother in the Upperclassmen cohort.
A triumphant story of the Class of 2018’s victory, winning the Daily News Cup for the third consecutive year.
The allure of what had not yet but would soon be my high school made me want to be like them – want to be admitted.

Over the course of the next two years, my interest in Stuyvesant grew exponentially.
I was awe-struck by the stories, both in school and online, of the competition which was Stuyvesant.
Of the victories and failures, the processes of stress and relaxation, the sea of students with personality.
I visited Stuyvesant in my first act of exploration, unaware that this was a routine for many applicants.
The classrooms were filled with such young maturity, stacks of textbooks and notes across each custom-built table.
Students were hard at work even in an environment with little supervision.

I yearned to be like them; The older students, who looked at me with unfiltered gazes and became so accustomed to their environment that they didn’t consider the beauty of it.
The familiarity was their prison, restricting them from seeing the magnificent and remarkable achievement that it was to be able to attend Stuyvesant.
I too would be like them, become a drone fitted for the system.

Stuyvesant High School is one of New York City's 9 specialized schools, which
instead of being open to all pupils, are open only to those who pass a
competitive entrance examination.  Specialized schools are ranked first through
nine and Stuyvesant is seen as the pinnacle of schools, the one most students
dream of attending.

I remember many years ago making the decision that Stuyvesant is the school I
wanted to go to, putting my name on the waiting list for prep classes and
feverishly opening prep books, studying for the test and looking forward to the
day that I would become a student at this school.  I even gave my poor father a
heart-attack during one of the middle school years, when, in a fit of pique, I
informed him that I was quitting school because, you know, I wanted time to
study for the admission test.

About a month and a half ago, I found one of the old prep books in my closet
and leafed through it again, nostalgically remembering the excitement of that
time.  I smiled, thinking how much I had changed, how I had grown up and how I
was grateful that I had actually gotten into the J.H.S. which is ranked much
lower, much less prestigious than Stuyvesant, so I could prove myself and go on
to the school I wanted to.

Two years ago, I was admitted and I remember gritting my teeth and hating those
other special ed kids who knew I was a special ed kid, who knew that the school
administrators had allowed me to pass through the bars of the main gate, had
brought me in to the front hall and said, "This one's from P.S.X, this one's
from P.S.Y, this one's from P.S.Z."  The latter ones, from the three specialized
middle schools, were pure, untainted by the middle class, by their wealthier
elements.  Walking around, I saw the security guards whisper, "Special ed," to
one another.

And the teachers treat me different, I remember thinking.  I remember thinking
the same thing, realizing the special treatment, the coddling, the glow of
kindness in the eye of a teacher, who, I knew, was being regulated, made to be
nicer.  Some teachers, I know, were mean intentionally, to exhibit fairness.
Others, genuinely, didn't want to batter the special ed kids, who, to tell the
truth, are all nice, sweet children.  I feel sorry for them, seeing how they
suffer and they never speak, never fight back.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. As an 8th grader, I saw all of the YouTube videos and articles depicting life at Stuyvesant – rigorous classes with the best teachers in New York City, a close-knit community of likeminded peers, and the opportunity to make a true difference in the world.

I bought into this vision of Stuyvesant, and I am now fully immersing myself in it. This is all you need in order to enjoy your time at Stuyvesant. Sure, rigor like you wouldn’t believe, but that’s only to make you stronger.

“Innovation comes from the producer – not the customer.”

Your homework load is not an issue you should bring up with your teachers. They know what they’re doing. You should just do it, and see the strength it brings. Have you ever worked out before? You only get stronger by overworking your muscles. Your brain works the same way – if you want to be better at something, you must practice.

The more you complain, the tougher it becomes.

It’s certainly not any less difficult than the top high schools in any other borough of New York City. And it’s certainly not easy. But there’s no way to join this community unless you accept its challenges.

Sure, Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all it’s hyped up to be, but it’s certainly not any less difficult than the top high schools in any other borough of New York City. And it’s certainly not easy.

But there’s no way to join this community unless you accept its challenges.

“You yourself are the creator of your own destiny.”

My experience here has been structurally difficult – almost too much so. I’d taken 6 APs by the end of my junior year, and each year, I find myself less able to manage the demands of the classes and extracurriculars.

smae

However, my experiences outside of the structures of school, with the other people at Stuyvesant, have been some of the best moments in my life.

On the eve of school ending, I have found myself more involved in the senior class this year than ever before, and whenever I feel like leaving school is a bad idea, I can always turn to an advisor or friend and talk it out. Ultimately, our bonds will outlast the entirety of our time at Stuyvesant, no matter how difficult it gets now.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.
I’ve heard great things about Stuyvesant ever since I could remember. I’ve been told just how special and amazing this school is and just how it looks great on college applications and resumes. Everyone always talked so glowingly about it, and I couldn’t wait to get to know what all the hype was about. When my results came out and I found out that I got into Stuyvesant, I felt like I won the lottery.

The first time I entered the building, I felt overwhelmed with all of sympathy. All of the tours that I attended in middle school didn’t do any justice. I was blown away by the architecture and by all of the innovative things going on around me. I had never been in a school building quite like it and never had that pleasure again. The most impressive part was the gallery of mathematics, with all of the past Math Team trophies. I wanted to grow up and be part of the Math Team and win those trophies. Every time I looked at the trophies I was driven to new heights of mathematical achievement. The t-shirts, the team tools – the only thing missing was half of the student body. Not even the entire high school I went to could ever fit at Stuyvesant.

While talking about my high school with other people, I met a girl who also got into Stuyvesant. We sat down at lunch together and talked about our experience about high school. I realized to my chagrin that that over the time of our admissions and high school years, the actual quality of education has weighed down significantly. My colleague from Stuyvesant agreed, going on to elaborate how many people who were a good match for her in terms of caliber and interests were leaving because they disliked the school. She added how many of them were leaving for nearby Bronx Science instead of Stuyvesant.

It seems that the administration uses the fame of the high school as a way to justify the ineffectiveness of their programs. Many classes that I’ve taken were taught in a program that clearly favors students who were already good at a subject. I took a Regents class in my freshman year in which the curriculum was more advanced that an AP level. I had taken AP Physics C in my junior and senior years of high school, and the concepts in the course were completely different. Never was I able to do a problem in the way that the teacher teaching it demonstrated.

While walking with my friends in the halls of the high school during a fire drill, I could see that I was going to have a hard time. I’m a junior, and it was still a year before I needed to apply to college. I had gotten accustomed to going to Stuyvesant, and if I had to go anywhere, I didn’t know where I would go.

When I first started walking the halls of Stuyvesant High School, I felt my heart pound as I was taking in its familiar air. What would I find in there? What did its tough reputation mean? What should I expect? Those thoughts sped their way through my head on that first day, to the point where I could barely focus. I could barely hear the tour guide's voice. I could barely see the sights he was so proudly presenting to us.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

If you had asked me how I felt about Stuyvesant High School during 8th grade, I probably would’ve told you that I was going to go to Stuyvesant if it was the last high school on the face of the earth, because it was “the best.” While I’m not saying that my feeling has changed, I definitely have a different outlook on Stuy’ now that I’m actually attending.

Seeing as I was an 8th grader attending a majority-minority middle school, I was naturally told that Stuyvesant was going to be a majority-white school and that I would feel very out of place. I wasn’t bothered at all by this. In fact, I was looking forward to being in a space with people who shared and embraced intellectual curiosity in the same way that I did.

I certainly felt out of place in other ways, though. I walked into the first day of Stuyvesant with a backpack and a lunch bag, (that’s not to say that all of the school-provided backpacks are unattractive, but I thought the one I picked out was cuter) sneakers, and an athletic cut blouse. That first day of school was filled with nothing but people standing in the hallway and chatting with each other, seemingly forming groups, and getting to know people from other feeder schools. 

I walked in, and I felt absolutely nothing. No real energy, no desire to talk to anyone in my grade. There were people who wanted to talk to me and get to know me, but I felt that they might judge me if I didn’t speak to them in perfectly grammatical English and with a perfect Brooklyn accent. I wasn’t super outgoing either, in either middle school or elementary school, and I found it very strange being surrounded by people who clearly knew each other even though everyone was in the same grade.

While other people would talk to you, as long as you wanted to talk to them too, they also wouldn’t care that much if you didn’t want to talk to them. Aside from that, doing things that were disliked were generally frowned upon. Examples include but are not limited to any type of physical contact or putting your feet on the set of lockers in the hallway. I never really had a problem with these rules, but I see how anyone who isn’t on the “gung ho” side of things would find it inhibiting to their individual growth and creativity.

Stuyvesant is a very stressful, very tiring place. In my opinion, for the better, but for a lot of people, the wrong reasons.

I’m not saying that it’s necessarily a bad school, but I just wish the idea and the reality of Stuyvesant weren’t so different.

When I was an eighth grader, I applied to the specialized
high schools in the city. It was incredibly stressful, and I didn’t know
much about what I was doing. I had told myself that I would be very
disappointed if I got into any school other than Stuyvesant. I knew
that Stuyvesant was a school for smart people, and that I was one of
the smartest people I knew.

So, when I was accepted to Stuyvesant, I was ecstatic. My
moment had come. The hard work had paid off. I was finally the smart
kid I knew I could be.

Fast forward to today, three and a half years later, almost
through my graduation year. The last four years at Stuyvesant have not
been the easy, nothing-to-worry-about years I thought they would be.
I’ve had more doubts on my own ability and mental health than I ever
had in middle school. I came to Stuyvesant expecting to thrive, and yet
I’ve gone through multiple mental breakdowns, had a teacher that treats
me unprofessionally, and felt that many of my passions weren’t mattering
because they weren’t AP classes. I’ve thought that I was always going to
be the smart kid, and yet I took diff eq first semester freshman year and
got a B on the final; I took physics C first semester junior year and got
a C on the final. I’ve been told that Stuyvesant is the best high school
in terms of academics, and yet I found myself bored, restless, and not
learning in my math and science classes. I don’t understand how I got
into this school, and this is the last place that a student should have
these types of thoughts.

In the future, I don’t know if I would take the offer to attend
Stuyvesant again. Not because I don’t think it’s a good school, but
because it’s not a good school for me. There’s a big difference between
being good at something and being happy doing that thing. As much as I
like to think hard and find problems that require creativity to solve, my
mental health takes a much bigger hit than it should in doing so. In
addition, Stuyvesant’s atmosphere doesn’t make me excited to learn. The
focus on grades and grades alone causes students to be unmotivated and
frustrated. Prior to the pandemic, it was canon to see students sitting
outside of school at the fences, deep in their thoughts, contemplating
their studies. While an observant look, they’re thinking about how to
create good grades and nothing more. 

I acknowledge that I am conscious of myself, and that this
essay doesn’t bring up every single aspect of Stuyvesant. Maybe I’ve
grown a little bit since I started, maybe I’ve matured a bit. But would
another kid go through the same thought processes that I did? Would
another kid join a handful of activities, learn to be a leader and a
manager, but spend a disproportionate amount of their time unhappily
doing so? Maybe I just didn’t fit in. Sure, I’m not the happiest and
glowingest of people, but I’m not a grey cloud either. But even still,
even if I fit in the exact ‘quirks and temperament’ of a typical Stuyvesant
kid, would I be happy? Or would I be more content in a school where I
didn’t have to work as hard, but where all of my passions were still
recognized? I’ll never know, but I think I would take that chance. My
identity isn’t defined by my grades, or how much I know. I’ve sacrificed
a lot to get the grades I have today, and while the numbers are written
and can’t be reversed, the cost isn’t worth it in the end. I’m not saying
taking the harder route to Stuyvesant was a mistake, nor would I say
that I regret it. But I’m not going to get out what I put into Stuyvesant.
I chose to make the sacrifices. But I’m not going to catch up to the
class, no matter how much I try.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.
My freshman year, I thought that I had made it to the top of NYC academia (which is not entirely true, but that's another matter).
In comes sophomore year and all my friends suddenly leave me to go to Summer Programs in the Rockies, Europe, or Egypt.
I was left trying to learn 3 languages all at once and also completing work for fashion design, as well as film and sound studies.
It's not that my friends were lacking the ability to do four courses, but they chose to do experiences which were outside of Stuyvesant.
I wasn't able to fit in entrance exams to these programs into my schedule since I was studying for my SATs.
I remember that I came home one day with a 96 in French after having gone over a test for about three hours.
I also remember that that day my best friend had gotten a 99 on the same test.
And although we have the same grading system, same teacher, etc. we don't have the same experience of Stuyvesant.
She made different choices than I.
I had my reasons for getting a 98 in the course last semester (I guess yoga can be counted as an extracurricular after all), and she had her reasons for pursuing different avenues.
To this day I wonder what it would have been like to do an immersive language program like my friends instead of diving straight into an AP course (that's right, I did French 5 AP this year).
But then again, if I could change the choices I made, I don't know how they would have affected me over these past two and a half years.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

If I could go back in time, I would tell myself not to get too invested in my video games, because I was happier when I used to play outside with friends. My own ambitions of joining a community that would change my entire high-school perception was (almost) fulfilled. If only I had the time, or patience, to do this sort of thing again.

This is what the average kid coming out of a lower-tier non-specialized middle school hears about Stuyvesant and thinks to himself at the time. The opportunity to be a part of a prevailing and revolutionary wave of learners who shape the future is sedating and intoxicating; an individual would be intoxicated by the very idea of a productive, synthesizing, successful and influential student experience.

But as it turns out, everybody else is thinking the same thing too.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

When I asked my friends why they chose to attend Staten Island Technical High School over Stuyvesant High School as their examination high school in eighth grade, most of them said something about the convenience of waking up every day at six thirty am and not having to take a train across town just to go to school. I, on the other hand, couldn’t resist the challenge of getting into the most esteemed examination high school in the city, especially since I was first introduced to the idea of examination high schools by a son of one of my mother’s closest friends, who had managed to guarantee his way into Stuyvesant through the test.

My friends asked me why I would choose to go to Stuyvesant instead of Staten Island Tech, especially since they were so certain that we had failed the test – even the son of my mother’s closest friend had only managed a 990 on the exam while they were certain they had scored worse than that. I was forced to lie to them, telling them that I had scored no lower than 980 to appease their feelings because I didn’t want to shatter their hopes of being accepted into the school of their dreams. In reality, I had scored no higher than 550. When comparing our results, the superiority of their scores over mine was about 70%. 

The time had finally arrived for the Department of Education to release the scores. 6:00 AM on the date allotted to us via the notice from the DOE, me and my father awoke at the break of dawn and logged onto the DOE’s Website, refreshed the page a few times to navigate to our scores, and finally got the score that I had been waiting for so eagerly for. 570. 580. The score rose and rose – 700, 730, until finally we saw two 9’s in the thousand’s place. I had successfully scored a 990, correcting my previous errors and allaying any fears of ineligibility. My parents were immensely pleased, and so was I. Filled with a sense of achievement, I told my friends the next day. To my surprise, they already knew – they had actually scored on that day, and had scored 995.

All was simple after that – being a male meant there were only three seats out of 3,000. Predictably, I did not get accepted. Neither did I get in through the waitlist. I tried going to Bronx Science instead – the second most esteemed examination high school in the city – but I hadn’t ever applied or taken the exam for that school when I was in eighth grade, and inform myself about this school later than my other friends. I was forced to apply for Staten Island Tech instead in the end, better late than never.

When I first visited Samuel Gottesman last year, I had hoped to get a good idea of what it was like at Stuyvesant. At the time I didn't know exactly what to expect. 

While this tour was helpful, to some extent, it also did not tell us the kind of details that you might want to get an idea of what Stuyvesant was truly like. We met our tour guide outside, who was once a student at Samuel Gottesman, and he was really really really really really really excited about the fact that he got into Stuyvesant, which reassured me that I probably would get in as well.

He led us into the school, and on our tour of the building, we ran into a few students and teachers, who were all very redvicious. The first student who happened to be walking by was blatantly rude, pushing past and not acknowledging us. 

The science student and I had some time to kill before heading back to our scheduled tour of Stuyvesant. We decided to wander the nearby neighborhood and decided to check out that famous 99 cent store. Even this five minute foray away from the school showed how differences between the quality of life that people live on the east and west sides of Stuyvesant High School.

I am not me. Not by a long shot. I was a different person one year ago. A different person two years ago. In a way, a different person every year of my life. Constantly morphing, constantly changing. If you were to ask me the same set of questions five years ago, I would tell you that in 5, I looked up to all of the seniors, I would be 18 years old, and I would most likely be enrolled in College. The truth is, I am more of a freshman/sophomore year hybrid. I have grown immensely from then, but am in no way close to the person I am to be.

This simple sounding truism comes in all shapes and sizes. In my case, I have never been an in-your-face, Rambo, hardcore alpha male (the kind with no emotions whatsoever). In fact, I have been the complete opposite for most of my life. Living obliviously and happily, rushing nowhere. This was simply a natural state of being brought about by the school and environment around me. But dammit, I wanted to change. High school has always been seen as a place to discover yourself and your personality, so you could place yourself wherever you want on the long Bell curve of the human condition (disclaimer: I do NOT believe in that false dichotomy). For example, if you wanted to be a cruel Bully and did not already exhibit these traits at an earlier age, you could mask yourself in these traits and seem "normal" this way. The same goes for any other category. Thus most people, more than at any other time of their lives, would attempt to "find themselves". What this often resulted in is young people repressing instincts that are really only natural. Being a well mannered, courteous citizen, for instance, is by no means a deterant to being the best that you yourself are capable of.

Realizing this absolute truth, I managed to train myself for this process. In a way, you could think of it as more of a journey than anything else. I mean, it was kind of faster than just one journey. Like, like going on a journey, realizing it is a journey, going on several different journeys but never quite reaching the "goal", making discoveries, and then it turns out there is no goal, or you don't want to reach the goal, or there isnt one at all. It is a journey. But it is a beeline. And I was crashing headfirst into the destination. I sped up and sped up, constantly learning about myself, about others, about the human condition, about love and romance, about reputation and character... It was going fast. It was going fast like a bullet train.

And now it's time to grow up. It is the beginning of the end of an entire life. It is the closing of one door and the opening of another. Until now I didn't even know it existed.

I can't see. I'm shaking. I'm shaking and scared and crying, or it's raining, or both. It's like a parent, but more protective. More growing up. More tenderness. Tenderness in an age where this is truly lacking. It's hard to find. A lack of maturity in my peers, and that of the adults. Nobody's what they seem. Nobody's what they signed up for. And the time to realize it is not yet at hand.

Unless it has already passed. Like sand through one's fingers.

I remember seeing my first ever eighth grade class photo in my homeroom. It was at Tweed. We all wore those blue grey button down dress shirts, some with the collar up, some with a tie that had a bit too much slop dripping off the sides. Our classmates were so radiant, some with lopsided smiles, others with eyes closed. I knew of course, as you probably do not, that these students were destined for greatness.

They were going to private schools, and renowned Specialty High Schools in New York, like Stuyvesant, Bronx Science and Staten Island Tech. These schools had lenient requirements other than high grades and good test scores. In order to get in to these schools, you would have to take a test called the Specialty High School Admissions Test.

Of course I was taking the test too. I was an eighth grader who lived in Harlem, Upper Manhattan and I attended Tweed Courthouse, the Department of Education’s headquarters. I fancied myself as excelling beyond my peers academically. My memory was one of those archetypical prodigals, a young boy with an immense amount of dedication growing up into a young man’s body, in the same manner as Jonathan Edwards, Jack Ma and Ray Kurzweil did. I like to think that in some part, I was. 

Unlike these gentlemen, I was an adolescent male in a hetero-normative straight white privilege family. Everyone around me was just like me. My surroundings were homogeneous. I was begotten of the children who were related to both the pastors and deacons of my church. I was the student in the middle school who loved book and always did their work, who always came to school. 

A dream of mine was to discover a new law of physics and such. This itself was an interesting thought, for a middle schooler who was struggling with identity. I love books and I loved being in school my entire life. At this point, my discovery of the scientific method had blossomed and the first traces of my thoughts that the universe became tangible and moldable. My capacity to understand nature and the universe, through reading scientific books was producing and quantitative phenomenon where I was discovering how nature worked. Studying physics in and of itself was a very mystical and magical process. I was taught through the explanations of Eugene Khutoryansky, David Halliday and Robert Resnick and Christian Huyghens. The world was a lot of different fields, with each type of interaction in the universe being described by its own equations. These equations contained all the information needed to know in order to makes sense of the natural phenomena. Light would refract in a substance once introduced. Colors would be strange, a lot of questions and the scientific method was my way of getting the questions out of my mind. 

And of course there was a lot of people telling me that this scientific method wouldn't hold up. They actively lie to you, consciously, or unconsciously by telling you that a heuristic was as good as a fulsome explanations. You would take models, transform them and make them into predictions for a text reading and discussion. And then create data, collect it and use the same model to find ways to create the most refined forms of data collection. That was what science was to me. But of course, it was different.

The scientists that I knew worked on it even harder. These people were slaving away, staring at numbers, figures and tables, they were making things happen in real time. My everyday life was starting to evolve into such an adventurous activity as well. My teacher, Ms. Tamara Smith, my homeroom teacher and advisory, who was also my Earth Science teacher was a young Black woman, with a very deep voice. This one woman taught me politics, who would later start her rapid education of me about the world around me. 

I was very studious, but I was also very distracted. I remember loving my school the way a child loves a nursery. The staff there were a gaggle of zany adults, that truly cared about you.

We all liked Ms. Deborah Ramos, the one counselor for the middle school, the adviser for the school newspaper. I knew of college, and my perfect destination was Howard University. 

"Her son made it. He done good. If he could do it, you can too." She would tell me, as I gradually understood how success was linked to a person’s families, and their own desire to succeed. College was my best option, I concluded. I was cognitively dependent on it. 

I was a daydreamer, but I was never in the position to help others out. Here I was listening to older students talk about college and what they wanted to do.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

I remember when I wanted to get into Stuyvesant. It was a goal of mine, but I eventually found the challenges for the SHSAT off-putting – especially since I had to study for that along with my regents. So I started putting my hopes on Hunter. And then I got in. Once I got in, I was amazed by the building, but I found the student body incredibly alienating. The culture is inhospitable for most students. The classroom instruction is abysmally disappointing – going through material at a glacial pace, and not quoting Marx even once. I didn't think that the demography was diverse enough as well – would it have killed the admissions office to admit a few more people of color?

But at the end of the day, I'm here today. And there's no real way I can do anything, expect him my ways by winning in that old dusty building on Chambers Street surrounded by broken dreams, foundering self-esteem, and unsatisfactory education system.

But it's not all that bad. There are some perks to being Stuyvesant kid.

First off: you're a Stuyvesant kid. When you're walking in the hallway, you're walking alongside the top students in NYC (at least according to the Department of Education's rankings on something called "the college readiness index"). These kids you're walking alongside represent the cream of NYC high school education and it makes you wonder: how did I land myself in this kind of exclusive club? Am I really up to these standards in order to be worthy of being in such an elite society?

Aside from questions like that, their are a significant number of perks to being a Stuyvesant kid: you get to take a bunch of cool classes, and you get to listen to your classmates say "I keep getting C's, but the answer is right here," while they click the A button on their graphing calculator, being convinced that they're absolutely genius, and in the same room where a bunch of AP computer science and physics kids think they're going to famous for making Minecraft multiplatform. The classes don't prepare you much, but the social experiences are outstanding.

So is it worth it going to school at a NYCDOE "Specialized High School"? Of course, what a ridiculous question. If you have the option to go to Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, Staten Island Tech, etc, then you have to go. I don't regret my time in Stuyvesant, because my stress and anguish pays off when I'm walking to class and hearing people who are on top of the world and are convinced that they're the best. They aren't; I am.

    My time at Stuyvesant High School has been a rollercoaster.
    For example, during the first winter at Stuy, as a freshman, I became alienated and isolated, having made far fewer friends than I had originally, and an estranged family member - now deceased - was all I had.
    Being a generally quiet and shy person made it difficult for me to get to the point where I could be comfortable with myself and others.
</p>
<p>
    Because of this discomfort with others, I gravitated toward a feeling of carelessness and being stressed, simply because I felt as if I didn’t deserve it, as if I had to prove myself to myself and others - to earn the right to feel comfortable.
    They say that high school is all about trying to prove ourselves and it apparently is; but that’s not true, and I know that now.
    Stuyvesant made me wiser, but in a general sense; there was a “I-want-to-leave-this-place” mentality, and while the work was challenging and difficult, everything else came first.
</p>
<p>
    I hated myself.
    Even when I changed myself to grow, there was only a small amount of growth - because people would simply complain that I’m “different”.
    Perhaps the idea or the practice of “different” is what keeps the world spinning; but too much different is the devil.
</p>
<p>
    Throughout Stuyvesant, the college process was hectic, for 4 years of high school, 2 in Yorktown, and 5 in total.
    when we were ‘juniors’, we learned about college and we wrote essays about our experiences and reflected upon the things that make us who we are.
    After we wrote those essays, we learned about the many different schools, applied to colleges, and by the end of it all - the process was done - we were done - we had done it!
</p>
<p>
    The college process was hectic.
    And it wasn’t fun - at all - it was boring and repetitive and stressful.
    Sometimes even I wonder, “am I good enough? Will I ever find my true identity?” then colleges come in, and all I wish is to gain more confidence.
    The constant fear of “am I good enough?” can be eliminated when applying to colleges similar to Stuyvesant, whether or not I believe myself when I say “I’m good enough for schools which are similar to Stuyvesant”
</p>
<p>
    I was disappointed with my performance in 2019, my fourth year at Stuyvesant, simply because I didn’t get a better GPA than what I got.
    I felt rather isolated from my friends and from people in general.
    I didn’t believe myself when I said I was good enough for anything in life because I failed some of my classes, most of them anyway, and I wasn’t happy. I didn’t want to be in a certain group of people, necessarily because I felt threatened by them.
    I felt judged by the eyes of the students - and the teachers - who judged me simply by the look on my face and the things that I did.
    Finally, I didn’t want to do work rather than enjoying my final year of high school, into my final year of high school. I longed for advice on what I should do with the time I had, but said time ran out before I even realized the time had passed.
    I wasn’t hopeful that Stuyvesant would be the place where I felt absolutely comfortable.
</p>
<p>
    And yet, even with all of that, my experiences at Stuyvesant have transformed and shaped me into the person whom I am today, who experiences themselves and their own shifts in attitude.
    Obviously, I look back, and I’m happy with some of the choices I made, the mistakes I made, and how I was able to protect myself and the people whom I cared deeply about but then again, I was able to protect myself without being hurt, without isolating myself from others, and without focusing on impossible aspirations for the future.
    My time at Stuyvesant consists of a lot of different experiences: sad to happy, happy to sad, not as happy to happier, not as sad, etc.
    When drifting away from the idea of “Stuyvesant life” I often wonder why I did many of the things that I did and why I didn’t do many of the things I didn’t end up doing.
    Who knows? I’m not perfect, by any means, but I’m a happy kid.
</p>
<p>
    To be honest, there is no such thing as right or wrong, good or bad.
    To state that there is something that is unquestionably right or wrong is pure nonsense.
    One could debate whatever they may want to debate, eventually ending up on that one thing that is the most right, or the most wrong, however - do we want to end up on that point of view where things follows a binary good/bad order?
    Time teaches us things and makes things better. In a general sense, it makes things better.
    For this reason, we are not born as successful people or determined people. We are born as people who have not achieved anything at all, with no idea of life.
</p>
<p>
    Honestly, I have too much to say about high school, so that’s that.
    This is where I leave my personal accounts for high school and the way I think of high school.
