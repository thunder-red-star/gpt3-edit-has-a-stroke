I remember hearing about Stuyvesant High School when I was a young middle schooler.  
I knew that it was the most prestigious, prestigious high school in New York.
While my friends were scrounging around the freshman high school fair, I walked straight to the Stuyvesant High School booth. There, a cute, poofy-haired young man with a face so white he looked unwholesome was helping attendees acquire information pamphlets.  
I asked him how I could, one day, become a student of Stuyvesant, a role model for middle schoolers everywhere. He took my right hand in his left and looked straight into my eyes.  
"The future is an open book with an unknown number of empty pages," I thought he said.  
"Yessss, delicious," I replied.  
"What was that?" I then heard him ask.  
"I said, 'Yes, delicious.' What did you say?" I inquired.  
He rolled his eyes. "Just study hard and get lucky, kid. It's a popularity contest," and released one of my fingers to perform some other task I was unaware of, because I had turned around and walked away in a huff.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

I remember staring at the school newspaper “The Spectator” as a 8th Grader in middle school
and admiring the bright lights of the city that were featured outside the classrooms on certain days.
I thought it was amazing how students could go through rigorous
courses while still finding a way to write articles and put together
high level media.
Little did I know that regular students also suffered through the
stress of the school just as much as I did; it was just that they found
a way to relieve it in a more productive manner.

High school is a bittersweet experience. In other words, there are some experiences which you do not wish to relive and
enjoy. I had heard that Stuyvesant High School was one of theoretically the best schools in New York, even the states.
My first experiences with the school system in New York was a disaster, since in the sixth grade, I had broken my
right leg from attempting to qualify for the Achilles Track Club. I had to miss a significant amount of time due to
the hospitalization, and so, I failed my sixth grade year, pushing me past my age at the time. Nonetheless, I attended
the Track Club, and was quite happy to do so.

One day, I thought to myself, "Wouldn't it be nice to attend one of New York's best high schools?" And so, I did the
programs, learned the tricks that were required in the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT). And eventually,
I was admitted to a school that I had only heard of. Welcome to Stuyvesant.

My freshman year, I felt like I was on top of the world. I was finally in Stuyvesant, the top public high school in New York City.

My PSAT score of 1954 had just been mailed home in a decorative envelope, stamped with a seal of approval from the College Board, stating that I was eligible for Commended recognition in recognition of my outstanding performance on the PSAT.

I was taking four AP classes: AP US History, AP English Language, AP Calculus BC, and AP Physics C. I'd had enough AP experience in middle school to feel confident passing them all.

I might have felt that feat envy towards the kids in my class taking 5 AP classes, but in my mind, increasing the academic rigor of classes by taking an additional AP class led to a net decrease in the amount one learned per unit of time. The stress would skyrocket, and test scores, which were the final culmination of learning for them, would plummet.

Or so I thought.

My sophomore year, I realized that I had little to actually boast about from my freshman year. 

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

When I was in 5th grade, I found a magnet on my refrigerator that had the word "Stuyvesant" printed on it. It had all of the names of the specialized NYC high schools. 

I had never heard of the school before, so I asked my parents what it was. My dad told me it was a very good school, in which only the smartest of kids were admitted.

I read the statistics that showed that unionized teachers at these high schools receive a salary of $160,000 a year. If they ever stopped being good at their job, it would be impossible to get rid of them. 

"That's amazing, being able to get a job that pays so well and is so secure", I thought. 

When I heard there was a 7th grade exam just for admissions, I immediately signed up for the test and started studying for months. 

Thankfully, I passed. In the 9th grade, I got off to a good start. 

However, as soon as I entered highschool, I realized that there were many things about our school that weren't as good as I had expected. 


The school was old and dirty; it looked exactly like the old electric power plants or water treatment facilities you see in the movies. The bathrooms had graffiti and that overpowering smell of adolescence. I couldn't really go to the bathroom after gym class, because they would be full of teenagers doing their own business. I went to a run down locker room where there were hardly any changing stalls and I changed my clothes in the bathroom stalls. 

In addition, the quality of the education needs improvement. 
In fact, I believe that bright kids at the top of their class at Bronx Science, Staten Island Technical High School, and even Brooklyn Tech would receive a significantly better education than most students at Stuyvesant. 

The school administration has been reluctant to fire badly performing teachers. Politically difficult decisions are left to the side. 

A better approach would be to model Stuyvesant High School after some of the best high schools in the country, such as Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, or even academic institutions like Harvey Mudd College, Georgetown University's MCV Campus, and Cooper Union. 

Even so, I appreciate the opportunities that Stuyvesant has given to me. However, I wish that the people at the school management level would think more clearly, and make the changes that need to be made.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

It was about two years ago when I first heard about this extraordinary school.
It was in an e-mail from a friend, who had a brother in the Upperclassmen cohort.
A triumphant story of the Class of 2018’s victory, winning the Daily News Cup for the third consecutive year.
The allure of what had not yet but would soon be my high school made me want to be like them – want to be admitted.

Over the course of the next two years, my interest in Stuyvesant grew exponentially.
I was awe-struck by the stories, both in school and online, of the competition which was Stuyvesant.
Of the victories and failures, the processes of stress and relaxation, the sea of students with personality.
I visited Stuyvesant in my first act of exploration, unaware that this was a routine for many applicants.
The classrooms were filled with such young maturity, stacks of textbooks and notes across each custom-built table.
Students were hard at work even in an environment with little supervision.

I yearned to be like them; The older students, who looked at me with unfiltered gazes and became so accustomed to their environment that they didn’t consider the beauty of it.
The familiarity was their prison, restricting them from seeing the magnificent and remarkable achievement that it was to be able to attend Stuyvesant.
I too would be like them, become a drone fitted for the system.

Stuyvesant High School is one of New York City's 9 specialized schools, which
instead of being open to all pupils, are open only to those who pass a
competitive entrance examination.  Specialized schools are ranked first through
nine and Stuyvesant is seen as the pinnacle of schools, the one most students
dream of attending.

I remember many years ago making the decision that Stuyvesant is the school I
wanted to go to, putting my name on the waiting list for prep classes and
feverishly opening prep books, studying for the test and looking forward to the
day that I would become a student at this school.  I even gave my poor father a
heart-attack during one of the middle school years, when, in a fit of pique, I
informed him that I was quitting school because, you know, I wanted time to
study for the admission test.

About a month and a half ago, I found one of the old prep books in my closet
and leafed through it again, nostalgically remembering the excitement of that
time.  I smiled, thinking how much I had changed, how I had grown up and how I
was grateful that I had actually gotten into the J.H.S. which is ranked much
lower, much less prestigious than Stuyvesant, so I could prove myself and go on
to the school I wanted to.

Two years ago, I was admitted and I remember gritting my teeth and hating those
other special ed kids who knew I was a special ed kid, who knew that the school
administrators had allowed me to pass through the bars of the main gate, had
brought me in to the front hall and said, "This one's from P.S.X, this one's
from P.S.Y, this one's from P.S.Z."  The latter ones, from the three specialized
middle schools, were pure, untainted by the middle class, by their wealthier
elements.  Walking around, I saw the security guards whisper, "Special ed," to
one another.

And the teachers treat me different, I remember thinking.  I remember thinking
the same thing, realizing the special treatment, the coddling, the glow of
kindness in the eye of a teacher, who, I knew, was being regulated, made to be
nicer.  Some teachers, I know, were mean intentionally, to exhibit fairness.
Others, genuinely, didn't want to batter the special ed kids, who, to tell the
truth, are all nice, sweet children.  I feel sorry for them, seeing how they
suffer and they never speak, never fight back.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. As an 8th grader, I saw all of the YouTube videos and articles depicting life at Stuyvesant – rigorous classes with the best teachers in New York City, a close-knit community of likeminded peers, and the opportunity to make a true difference in the world.

I bought into this vision of Stuyvesant, and I am now fully immersing myself in it. This is all you need in order to enjoy your time at Stuyvesant. Sure, rigor like you wouldn’t believe, but that’s only to make you stronger.

“Innovation comes from the producer – not the customer.”

Your homework load is not an issue you should bring up with your teachers. They know what they’re doing. You should just do it, and see the strength it brings. Have you ever worked out before? You only get stronger by overworking your muscles. Your brain works the same way – if you want to be better at something, you must practice.

The more you complain, the tougher it becomes.

It’s certainly not any less difficult than the top high schools in any other borough of New York City. And it’s certainly not easy. But there’s no way to join this community unless you accept its challenges.

Sure, Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all it’s hyped up to be, but it’s certainly not any less difficult than the top high schools in any other borough of New York City. And it’s certainly not easy.

But there’s no way to join this community unless you accept its challenges.

“You yourself are the creator of your own destiny.”

My experience here has been structurally difficult – almost too much so. I’d taken 6 APs by the end of my junior year, and each year, I find myself less able to manage the demands of the classes and extracurriculars.

Same.

However, my experiences outside of the structures of school, with the other people at Stuyvesant, have been some of the best moments in my life.

On the eve of school ending, I have found myself more involved in the senior class this year than ever before, and whenever I feel like leaving school is a bad idea, I can always turn to an advisor or friend and talk it out. Ultimately, our bonds will outlast the entirety of our time at Stuyvesant, no matter how difficult it gets now.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.
I’ve heard great things about Stuyvesant ever since I could remember. I’ve been told just how special and amazing this school is and just how it looks great on college applications and resumes. Everyone always talked so glowingly about it, and I couldn’t wait to get to know what all the hype was about. When my results came out and I found out that I got into Stuyvesant, I felt like I won the lottery.

The first time I entered the building, I felt overwhelmed with all of sympathy. All of the tours that I attended in middle school didn’t do any justice. I was blown away by the architecture and by all of the innovative things going on around me. I had never been in a school building quite like it and never had that pleasure again. The most impressive part was the gallery of mathematics, with all of the past Math Team trophies. I wanted to grow up and be part of the Math Team and win those trophies. Every time I looked at the trophies I was driven to new heights of mathematical achievement. The t-shirts, the team tools – the only thing missing was half of the student body. Not even the entire high school I went to could ever fit at Stuyvesant.

While talking about my high school with other people, I met a girl who also got into Stuyvesant. We sat down at lunch together and talked about our experience about high school. I realized to my chagrin that that over the time of our admissions and high school years, the actual quality of education has weighed down significantly. My colleague from Stuyvesant agreed, going on to elaborate how many people who were a good match for her in terms of caliber and interests were leaving because they disliked the school. She added how many of them were leaving for nearby Bronx Science instead of Stuyvesant.

It seems that the administration uses the fame of the high school as a way to justify the ineffectiveness of their programs. Many classes that I’ve taken were taught in a program that clearly favors students who were already good at a subject. I took a Regents class in my freshman year in which the curriculum was more advanced that an AP level. I had taken AP Physics C in my junior and senior years of high school, and the concepts in the course were completely different. Never was I able to do a problem in the way that the teacher teaching it demonstrated.

While walking with my friends in the halls of the high school during a fire drill, I could see that I was going to have a hard time. I’m a junior, and it was still a year before I needed to apply to college. I had gotten accustomed to going to Stuyvesant, and if I had to go anywhere, I didn’t know where I would go.

# 10
When I first started walking the halls of Stuyvesant High School, I felt my heart pound as I was taking in its familiar air. What would I find in there? What did its tough reputation mean? What should I expect? Those thoughts sped their way through my head on that first day, to the point where I could barely focus. I could barely hear the tour guide's voice. I could barely see the sights he was so proudly presenting to us.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

If you had asked me how I felt about Stuyvesant High School during 8th grade, I probably would’ve told you that I was going to go to Stuyvesant if it was the last high school on the face of the earth, because it was “the best.” While I’m not saying that my feeling has changed, I definitely have a different outlook on Stuy’ now that I’m actually attending.

Seeing as I was an 8th grader attending a majority-minority middle school, I was naturally told that Stuyvesant was going to be a majority-white school and that I would feel very out of place. I wasn’t bothered at all by this. In fact, I was looking forward to being in a space with people who shared and embraced intellectual curiosity in the same way that I did.

I certainly felt out of place in other ways, though. I walked into the first day of Stuyvesant with a backpack and a lunch bag, (that’s not to say that all of the school-provided backpacks are unattractive, but I thought the one I picked out was cuter) sneakers, and an athletic cut blouse. That first day of school was filled with nothing but people standing in the hallway and chatting with each other, seemingly forming groups, and getting to know people from other feeder schools. 

I walked in, and I felt absolutely nothing. No real energy, no desire to talk to anyone in my grade. There were people who wanted to talk to me and get to know me, but I felt that they might judge me if I didn’t speak to them in perfectly grammatical English and with a perfect Brooklyn accent. I wasn’t super outgoing either, in either middle school or elementary school, and I found it very strange being surrounded by people who clearly knew each other even though everyone was in the same grade.

While other people would talk to you, as long as you wanted to talk to them too, they also wouldn’t care that much if you didn’t want to talk to them. Aside from that, doing things that were disliked were generally frowned upon. Examples include but are not limited to any type of physical contact or putting your feet on the set of lockers in the hallway. I never really had a problem with these rules, but I see how anyone who isn’t on the “gung ho” side of things would find it inhibiting to their individual growth and creativity.

Stuyvesant is a very stressful, very tiring place. In my opinion, for the better, but for a lot of people, the wrong reasons.

I’m not saying that it’s necessarily a bad school, but I just wish the idea and the reality of Stuyvesant weren’t so different. 

# 12
When I was an eighth grader, I applied to the specialized
high schools in the city. It was incredibly stressful, and I didn’t know
much about what I was doing. I had told myself that I would be very
disappointed if I got into any school other than Stuyvesant. I knew
that Stuyvesant was a school for smart people, and that I was one of
the smartest people I knew.

So, when I was accepted to Stuyvesant, I was ecstatic. My
moment had come. The hard work had paid off. I was finally the smart
kid I knew I could be.

Fast forward to today, three and a half years later, almost
through my graduation year. The last four years at Stuyvesant have not
been the easy, nothing-to-worry-about years I thought they would be.
I’ve had more doubts on my own ability and mental health than I ever
had in middle school. I came to Stuyvesant expecting to thrive, and yet
I’ve gone through multiple mental breakdowns, had a teacher that treats
me unprofessionally, and felt that many of my passions weren’t mattering
because they weren’t AP classes. I’ve thought that I was always going to
be the smart kid, and yet I took diff eq first semester freshman year and
got a B on the final; I took physics C first semester junior year and got
a C on the final. I’ve been told that Stuyvesant is the best high school
in terms of academics, and yet I found myself bored, restless, and not
learning in my math and science classes. I don’t understand how I got
into this school, and this is the last place that a student should have
these types of thoughts.

In the future, I don’t know if I would take the offer to attend
Stuyvesant again. Not because I don’t think it’s a good school, but
because it’s not a good school for me. There’s a big difference between
being good at something and being happy doing that thing. As much as I
like to think hard and find problems that require creativity to solve, my
mental health takes a much bigger hit than it should in doing so. In
addition, Stuyvesant’s atmosphere doesn’t make me excited to learn. The
focus on grades and grades alone causes students to be unmotivated and
frustrated. Prior to the pandemic, it was canon to see students sitting
outside of school at the fences, deep in their thoughts, contemplating
their studies. While an observant look, they’re thinking about how to
create good grades and nothing more. 

I acknowledge that I am conscious of myself, and that this
essay doesn’t bring up every single aspect of Stuyvesant. Maybe I’ve
grown a little bit since I started, maybe I’ve matured a bit. But would
another kid go through the same thought processes that I did? Would
another kid join a handful of activities, learn to be a leader and a
manager, but spend a disproportionate amount of their time unhappily
doing so? Maybe I just didn’t fit in. Sure, I’m not the happiest and
glowingest of people, but I’m not a grey cloud either. But even still,
even if I fit in the exact ‘quirks and temperament’ of a typical Stuyvesant
kid, would I be happy? Or would I be more content in a school where I
didn’t have to work as hard, but where all of my passions were still
recognized? I’ll never know, but I think I would take that chance. My
identity isn’t defined by my grades, or how much I know. I’ve sacrificed
a lot to get the grades I have today, and while the numbers are written
and can’t be reversed, the cost isn’t worth it in the end. I’m not saying
taking the harder route to Stuyvesant was a mistake, nor would I say
that I regret it. But I’m not going to get out what I put into Stuyvesant.
I chose to make the sacrifices. But I’m not going to catch up to the
class, no matter how much I try.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.
My freshman year, I thought that I had made it to the top of NYC academia (which is not entirely true, but that's another matter).
In comes sophomore year and all my friends suddenly leave me to go to Summer Programs in the Rockies, Europe, or Egypt.
I was left trying to learn 3 languages all at once and also completing work for fashion design, as well as film and sound studies.
It's not that my friends were lacking the ability to do four courses, but they chose to do experiences which were outside of Stuyvesant.
I wasn't able to fit in entrance exams to these programs into my schedule since I was studying for my SATs.
I remember that I came home one day with a 96 in French after having gone over a test for about three hours.
I also remember that that day my best friend had gotten a 99 on the same test.
And although we have the same grading system, same teacher, etc. we don't have the same experience of Stuyvesant.
She made different choices than I.
I had my reasons for getting a 98 in the course last semester (I guess yoga can be counted as an extracurricular after all), and she had her reasons for pursuing different avenues.
To this day I wonder what it would have been like to do an immersive language program like my friends instead of diving straight into an AP course (that's right, I did French 5 AP this year).
But then again, if I could change the choices I made, I don't know how they would have affected me over these past two and a half years.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

If I could go back in time, I would tell myself not to get too invested in my video games, because I was happier when I used to play outside with friends. My own ambitions of joining a community that would change my entire high-school perception was (almost) fulfilled. If only I had the time, or patience, to do this sort of thing again.

This is what the average kid coming out of a lower-tier non-specialized middle school hears about Stuyvesant and thinks to himself at the time. The opportunity to be a part of a prevailing and revolutionary wave of learners who shape the future is sedating and intoxicating; an individual would be intoxicated by the very idea of a productive, synthesizing, successful and influential student experience.

But as it turns out, everybody else is thinking the same thing too.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

When I asked my friends why they chose to attend Staten Island Technical High School over Stuyvesant High School as their examination high school in eighth grade, most of them said something about the convenience of waking up every day at six thirty am and not having to take a train across town just to go to school. I, on the other hand, couldn’t resist the challenge of getting into the most esteemed examination high school in the city, especially since I was first introduced to the idea of examination high schools by a son of one of my mother’s closest friends, who had managed to guarantee his way into Stuyvesant through the test.

My friends asked me why I would choose to go to Stuyvesant instead of Staten Island Tech, especially since they were so certain that we had failed the test – even the son of my mother’s closest friend had only managed a 990 on the exam while they were certain they had scored worse than that. I was forced to lie to them, telling them that I had scored no lower than 980 to appease their feelings because I didn’t want to shatter their hopes of being accepted into the school of their dreams. In reality, I had scored no higher than 550. When comparing our results, the superiority of their scores over mine was about 70%. 

The time had finally arrived for the Department of Education to release the scores. 6:00 AM on the date allotted to us via the notice from the DOE, me and my father awoke at the break of dawn and logged onto the DOE’s Website, refreshed the page a few times to navigate to our scores, and finally got the score that I had been waiting for so eagerly for. 570. 580. The score rose and rose – 700, 730, until finally we saw two 9’s in the thousand’s place. I had successfully scored a 990, correcting my previous errors and allaying any fears of ineligibility. My parents were immensely pleased, and so was I. Filled with a sense of achievement, I told my friends the next day. To my surprise, they already knew – they had actually scored on that day, and had scored 995.

All was simple after that – being a male meant there were only three seats out of 3,000. Predictably, I did not get accepted. Neither did I get in through the waitlist. I tried going to Bronx Science instead – the second most esteemed examination high school in the city – but I hadn’t ever applied or taken the exam for that school when I was in eighth grade, and inform myself about this school later than my other friends. I was forced to apply for Staten Island Tech instead in the end, better late than never.

When I first visited Samuel Gottesman last year, I had hoped to get a good idea of what it was like at Stuyvesant. At the time I didn't know exactly what to expect. 

While this tour was helpful, to some extent, it also did not tell us the kind of details that you might want to get an idea of what Stuyvesant was truly like. We met our tour guide outside, who was once a student at Samuel Gottesman, and he was really really really really really really excited about the fact that he got into Stuyvesant, which reassured me that I probably would get in as well.

He led us into the school, and on our tour of the building, we ran into a few students and teachers, who were all very redvicious. The first student who happened to be walking by was blatantly rude, pushing past and not acknowledging us. 

The science student and I had some time to kill before heading back to our scheduled tour of Stuyvesant. We decided to wander the nearby neighborhood and decided to check out that famous 99 cent store. Even this five minute foray away from the school showed how differences between the quality of life that people live on the east and west sides of Stuyvesant High School.

I am not me. Not by a long shot. I was a different person one year ago. A different person two years ago. In a way, a different person every year of my life. Constantly morphing, constantly changing. If you were to ask me the same set of questions five years ago, I would tell you that in 5, I looked up to all of the seniors, I would be 18 years old, and I would most likely be enrolled in College. The truth is, I am more of a freshman/sophomore year hybrid. I have grown immensely from then, but am in no way close to the person I am to be.

This simple sounding truism comes in all shapes and sizes. In my case, I have never been an in-your-face, Rambo, hardcore alpha male (the kind with no emotions whatsoever). In fact, I have been the complete opposite for most of my life. Living obliviously and happily, rushing nowhere. This was simply a natural state of being brought about by the school and environment around me. But dammit, I wanted to change. High school has always been seen as a place to discover yourself and your personality, so you could place yourself wherever you want on the long Bell curve of the human condition (disclaimer: I do NOT believe in that false dichotomy). For example, if you wanted to be a cruel Bully and did not already exhibit these traits at an earlier age, you could mask yourself in these traits and seem "normal" this way. The same goes for any other category. Thus most people, more than at any other time of their lives, would attempt to "find themselves". What this often resulted in is young people repressing instincts that are really only natural. Being a well mannered, courteous citizen, for instance, is by no means a deterant to being the best that you yourself are capable of.

Realizing this absolute truth, I managed to train myself for this process. In a way, you could think of it as more of a journey than anything else. I mean, it was kind of faster than just one journey. Like, like going on a journey, realizing it is a journey, going on several different journeys but never quite reaching the "goal", making discoveries, and then it turns out there is no goal, or you don't want to reach the goal, or there isnt one at all. It is a journey. But it is a beeline. And I was crashing headfirst into the destination. I sped up and sped up, constantly learning about myself, about others, about the human condition, about love and romance, about reputation and character... It was going fast. It was going fast like a bullet train.

And now it's time to grow up. It is the beginning of the end of an entire life. It is the closing of one door and the opening of another. Until now I didn't even know it existed.

I can't see. I'm shaking. I'm shaking and scared and crying, or it's raining, or both. It's like a parent, but more protective. More growing up. More tenderness. Tenderness in an age where this is truly lacking. It's hard to find. A lack of maturity in my peers, and that of the adults. Nobody's what they seem. Nobody's what they signed up for. And the time to realize it is not yet at hand.

Unless it has already passed. Like sand through one's fingers.

I remember seeing my first ever eighth grade class photo in my homeroom. It was at Tweed. We all wore those blue grey button down dress shirts, some with the collar up, some with a tie that had a bit too much slop dripping off the sides. Our classmates were so radiant, some with lopsided smiles, others with eyes closed. I knew of course, as you probably do not, that these students were destined for greatness.

They were going to private schools, and renowned Specialty High Schools in New York, like Stuyvesant, Bronx Science and Staten Island Tech. These schools had lenient requirements other than high grades and good test scores. In order to get in to these schools, you would have to take a test called the Specialty High School Admissions Test.

Of course I was taking the test too. I was an eighth grader who lived in Harlem, Upper Manhattan and I attended Tweed Courthouse, the Department of Education’s headquarters. I fancied myself as excelling beyond my peers academically. My memory was one of those archetypical prodigals, a young boy with an immense amount of dedication growing up into a young man’s body, in the same manner as Jonathan Edwards, Jack Ma and Ray Kurzweil did. I like to think that in some part, I was. 

Unlike these gentlemen, I was an adolescent male in a hetero-normative straight white privilege family. Everyone around me was just like me. My surroundings were homogeneous. I was begotten of the children who were related to both the pastors and deacons of my church. I was the student in the middle school who loved book and always did their work, who always came to school. 

A dream of mine was to discover a new law of physics and such. This itself was an interesting thought, for a middle schooler who was struggling with identity. I love books and I loved being in school my entire life. At this point, my discovery of the scientific method had blossomed and the first traces of my thoughts that the universe became tangible and moldable. My capacity to understand nature and the universe, through reading scientific books was producing and quantitative phenomenon where I was discovering how nature worked. Studying physics in and of itself was a very mystical and magical process. I was taught through the explanations of Eugene Khutoryansky, David Halliday and Robert Resnick and Christian Huyghens. The world was a lot of different fields, with each type of interaction in the universe being described by its own equations. These equations contained all the information needed to know in order to makes sense of the natural phenomena. Light would refract in a substance once introduced. Colors would be strange, a lot of questions and the scientific method was my way of getting the questions out of my mind. 

And of course there was a lot of people telling me that this scientific method wouldn't hold up. They actively lie to you, consciously, or unconsciously by telling you that a heuristic was as good as a fulsome explanations. You would take models, transform them and make them into predictions for a text reading and discussion. And then create data, collect it and use the same model to find ways to create the most refined forms of data collection. That was what science was to me. But of course, it was different.

The scientists that I knew worked on it even harder. These people were slaving away, staring at numbers, figures and tables, they were making things happen in real time. My everyday life was starting to evolve into such an adventurous activity as well. My teacher, Ms. Tamara Smith, my homeroom teacher and advisory, who was also my Earth Science teacher was a young Black woman, with a very deep voice. This one woman taught me politics, who would later start her rapid education of me about the world around me. 

I was very studious, but I was also very distracted. I remember loving my school the way a child loves a nursery. The staff there were a gaggle of zany adults, that truly cared about you.

We all liked Ms. Deborah Ramos, the one counselor for the middle school, the adviser for the school newspaper. I knew of college, and my perfect destination was Howard University. 

"Her son made it. He done good. If he could do it, you can too." She would tell me, as I gradually understood how success was linked to a person’s families, and their own desire to succeed. College was my best option, I concluded. I was cognitively dependent on it. 

I was a daydreamer, but I was never in the position to help others out. Here I was listening to older students talk about college and what they wanted to do.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

I remember when I wanted to get into Stuyvesant. It was a goal of mine, but I eventually found the challenges for the SHSAT off-putting – especially since I had to study for that along with my regents. So I started putting my hopes on Hunter. And then I got in. Once I got in, I was amazed by the building, but I found the student body incredibly alienating. The culture is inhospitable for most students. The classroom instruction is abysmally disappointing – going through material at a glacial pace, and not quoting Marx even once. I didn't think that the demography was diverse enough as well – would it have killed the admissions office to admit a few more people of color?

But at the end of the day, I'm here today. And there's no real way I can do anything, expect him my ways by winning in that old dusty building on Chambers Street surrounded by broken dreams, foundering self-esteem, and unsatisfactory education system.

But it's not all that bad. There are some perks to being a Stuyvesant kid.

First off: you're a Stuyvesant kid. When you're walking in the hallway, you're walking alongside the top students in NYC (at least according to the Department of Education's rankings on something called "the college readiness index"). These kids you're walking alongside represent the cream of NYC high school education and it makes you wonder: how did I land myself in this kind of exclusive club? Am I really up to these standards in order to be worthy of being in such an elite society?

Aside from questions like that, their are a significant number of perks to being a Stuyvesant kid: you get to take a bunch of cool classes, and you get to listen to your classmates say "I keep getting C's, but the answer is right here," while they click the A button on their graphing calculator, being convinced that they're absolutely genius, and in the same room where a bunch of AP computer science and physics kids think they're going to famous for making Minecraft multiplatform. The classes don't prepare you much, but the social experiences are outstanding.

So is it worth it going to school at a NYCDOE "Specialized High School"? Of course, what a ridiculous question. If you have the option to go to Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, Staten Island Tech, etc, then you have to go. I don't regret my time in Stuyvesant, because my stress and anguish pays off when I'm walking to class and hearing people who are on top of the world and are convinced that they're the best. They aren't; I am.

    My time at Stuyvesant High School has been a rollercoaster.
    For example, during the first winter at Stuy, as a freshman, I became alienated and isolated, having made far fewer friends than I had originally, and an estranged family member - now deceased - was all I had.
    Being a generally quiet and shy person made it difficult for me to get to the point where I could be comfortable with myself and others.
</p>
<p>
    Because of this discomfort with others, I gravitated toward a feeling of carelessness and being stressed, simply because I felt as if I didn’t deserve it, as if I had to prove myself to myself and others - to earn the right to feel comfortable.
    They say that high school is all about trying to prove ourselves and it apparently is; but that’s not true, and I know that now.
    Stuyvesant made me wiser, but in a general sense; there was a “I-want-to-leave-this-place” mentality, and while the work was challenging and difficult, everything else came first.
</p>
<p>
    I hated myself.
    Even when I changed myself to grow, there was only a small amount of growth - because people would simply complain that I’m “different”.
    Perhaps the idea or the practice of “different” is what keeps the world spinning; but too much different is the devil.
</p>
<p>
    Throughout Stuyvesant, the college process was hectic, for 4 years of high school, 2 in Yorktown, and 5 in total.
    when we were ‘juniors’, we learned about college and we wrote essays about our experiences and reflected upon the things that make us who we are.
    After we wrote those essays, we learned about the many different schools, applied to colleges, and by the end of it all - the process was done - we were done - we had done it!
</p>
<p>
    The college process was hectic.
    And it wasn’t fun - at all - it was boring and repetitive and stressful.
    Sometimes even I wonder, “am I good enough? Will I ever find my true identity?” then colleges come in, and all I wish is to gain more confidence.
    The constant fear of “am I good enough?” can be eliminated when applying to colleges similar to Stuyvesant, whether or not I believe myself when I say “I’m good enough for schools which are similar to Stuyvesant”
</p>
<p>
    I was disappointed with my performance in 2019, my fourth year at Stuyvesant, simply because I didn’t get a better GPA than what I got.
    I felt rather isolated from my friends and from people in general.
    I didn’t believe myself when I said I was good enough for anything in life because I failed some of my classes, most of them anyway, and I wasn’t happy. I didn’t want to be in a certain group of people, necessarily because I felt threatened by them.
    I felt judged by the eyes of the students - and the teachers - who judged me simply by the look on my face and the things that I did.
    Finally, I didn’t want to do work rather than enjoying my final year of high school, into my final year of high school. I longed for advice on what I should do with the time I had, but said time ran out before I even realized the time had passed.
    I wasn’t hopeful that Stuyvesant would be the place where I felt absolutely comfortable.
</p>
<p>
    And yet, even with all of that, my experiences at Stuyvesant have transformed and shaped me into the person whom I am today, who experiences themselves and their own shifts in attitude.
    Obviously, I look back, and I’m happy with some of the choices I made, the mistakes I made, and how I was able to protect myself and the people whom I cared deeply about but then again, I was able to protect myself without being hurt, without isolating myself from others, and without focusing on impossible aspirations for the future.
    My time at Stuyvesant consists of a lot of different experiences: sad to happy, happy to sad, not as happy to happier, not as sad, etc.
    When drifting away from the idea of “Stuyvesant life” I often wonder why I did many of the things that I did and why I didn’t do many of the things I didn’t end up doing.
    Who knows? I’m not perfect, by any means, but I’m a happy kid.
</p>
<p>
    To be honest, there is no such thing as right or wrong, good or bad.
    To state that there is something that is unquestionably right or wrong is pure nonsense.
    One could debate whatever they may want to debate, eventually ending up on that one thing that is the most right, or the most wrong, however - do we want to end up on that point of view where things follows a binary good/bad order?
    Time teaches us things and makes things better. In a general sense, it makes things better.
    For this reason, we are not born as successful people or determined people. We are born as people who have not achieved anything at all, with no idea of life.
</p>
<p>
    Honestly, I have too much to say about high school, so that’s that.
    This is where I leave my personal accounts for high school and the way I think of high school.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.
Personally, I had aspirations to be admitted to Stuy, but after having spent the past 2 years and counting in the hallways of 345 Chambers, the academic expectations and reality on the other side of the gate is overwhelming, to say the least.

Like each school, Stuy is not perfect, but I consider myself lucky enough to be here, amongst a plethora of intelligent kids; I have found, however, that a student’s persona’s, while intelligent as a whole, short-minded as well; some people choose to lock themselves up in their rooms, debating esoteric subjects and playing video games until 4 in the morning, while others attend classes with the sole intention of sleeping through their days.
I don’t think I lean too far either direction; having grown up with a solid schedule of sleeping at 10:00 and waking up naturally at 6:00 every morning since kindergarten, I have never been a sleepless individual like others who take 5 APs as a senior and 2 APs as a junior.
Because of this, my friends warn me that I’m being “unintelligent” for not burning the midnight oil in constant study for my Regents, or taking harder courses than the APs I’m currently taking.
While I’m aware of their insistence, I’m slowly learning to do things to my own targets and expectations – if something doesn’t have to be done, I’ll just not do it.
Also, I find it useless to compare yourself to your friends and peers; I’ve never been the typical A+ student (I’m not one of the ones teachers are always praising), and I’m definitely not the one with a multitude of problems at my fingertips – sometimes I find something fun in just being different.
Thank you for reading.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be, 
though that’s saying something considering my lofty expectations. As a 
middle schooler, I had heard an endless stream of both positive and negative 
stories and anecdotes concerning this school. Some of these stories were 
from friends, others were decidedly less trustworthy. Many were vague 
from uncertainty and over-excitement. Because of this, I entered my first 
year of high school with a bang of enthusiasm, ready for a school that I had 
managed to envision as both heaven and hell. However, what my thirteen 
year-old self was certainly unprepared for was experiencing another feeling 
quite unlike inspiration from this atmosphere and subsequently, a haunting 
of high expectations and the alienation that follows. 

In truth, this all started from this idea of personal alienation. Although 
this is certainly not a school of personal enrichment, which it was for 
me up until about my middle school years, I did find the loving group of 
forgotten who, due to personal ties and beliefs, attempted to overlook the 
sini nihilism that permeated Stuyvesant and instead concoct a warm, passionate 
dialogue concerning everything (from love, to death, to the qualities of 
Ringo Starr’s Beatles tenure).

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

It is recognized for having the best educational opportunities in New York City.
With over 4,000 students attending the high school, it receives the most sumbissions in the annual specialized high school exam of all the schools.
However, the students aren't necessarily the best students attending the high school, they are students which have expected the very best out of themselves.
These students are determined, hard working, and in the end, not necessarily very smart.
Smart at doing well on exams and exams alone.

Many students solely attend in order to get into their dream college.
This is possible at Stuy because of their
large academic departments and great alumni connections.

When attending Stuy, or any specialized high school, the students are expected to
have very few friend, and have the highest test scores.
Failure is not an option, because in the end, your success is what is best for yourself and your family. This idea of communal thinking and working as a commune towards the goverment and towards our society is unusual for a school in a location of <redacted> City. Our largest
destructions are due to the large multicultural demographics in New York.
Because of this, Stuy, unfortunately, is a very get-your-ba don't-do-fun-activities kind of high school.

I was admitted across the boroughs to all specialized high school. However, I only applied to Stuy.
This elevated-task of only getting into specialized high schools was very hard. I worked very hard on getting in.
This included sitting through 45 minute tutoring lessons with Ivy league high school students.

When I came to Stuy, I was invited to the comunity with open arms. The administration has made students feel like they are wanted unlike any before I have known of. This is the one reason why attending here is so favorable. However, I feel that even after my junior year at Stuy, I am not considered "worthy" of being a student. This is because I am not active in the community, as I don't want to be. The community isolates those who want to self-isolate. I do not want to be a part of it.

I use this to my advantage, however. I don't make friends easily. Well, making friends has never been easy. But I never truly felt at home before. I have now. I have found many people like myself, who just want to go through high school and succeed. I know that many people feel welcome to; contribute to the community, but take the resources away by attending. I, however, am that way around. I take the resources and contribute very little to the community. And I am completely fine with that. Whether or not the administration is pleased with that.

I've endured many love-triangle, gay-rejection and homosexual-act love stories. This is quite usual for a gay man. These relationships were very harsh and difficult to get into, as these people were young and didn't know how to interact with people who were gay.

"Stuyvesant" – a word that makes every eighth grader in New York squirm in their classroom seats. 

I remember that as an eighth grader, leaving the Bronx and going to Regis High School for high school exams terrified me. Going to Stuyvesant back 
then seemed impossible.

But I've grown to understand why that is.

Having the reputation for being one of the most prestigious pubic schools in the world comes with a cost – a high one. Let's look at Stuyvesant's excellent science programs for a second. Students are given not one, not two – but four science periods a day. Why? That's all Stuyvesant cares about – a 95+ average, in every subject. 

Stuyvesant cares so much about these grades, they have to teach 2 separate classes to learn physics. It's not because its that difficult: it's way too easy. These classes are taught in such a way that its boring and meaningless, yet the school seems to believe that this is how students learn. Everyone laughs at me when I say this, but it's the most boring thing I've ever had to do. I was literally asked to stare at my computer for 30 minutes in a topic, pretending like I'm learning.

The absurdity of everything at Stuyvesant doesn't stop there though. For some reason, Stuyvesant expects their kids to be, well, miserable. You see all around campus kids stressing and going through this whirlwind of emotions. All this pain, just because they want to perfect their ACT score, or to compete in another debate session. 

Going through all this pain, while I can turn left and see the One World Trade Center – to know that life outside these school walls isn't all that useless. There's opportunities everywhere – my next scholarship, or the guy I'd fall in love with, or the next country where I'd study abroad – and here I am, within a four-block radius, self-induced by the school that I either love and hate.

When I entered the eighth grade, my older brother, was jealous of me. For one thing, I was shorter than he was and also, (and more importantly) I was about to enter a different, MUCH more prestigious High School. At the time, I knew where I was going to go, I had heard nothing but praise from family and friends about the astonishingly academically inclined High School I was planning on attending. This school promised that an easy ride, to College, Corpoardate America, and global success would be just but a road straight out of it’s wide double doors. And yet, upon arriving there, I saw–absolutely nothing. 

By the end of October, entering the High School, I was feeling quite disillusioned. Every one of the teachers were unwelcoming and intimidating, My worries began to grow. This was nothing like what family and friends had portrayed it as. Everyone I had talked to who was from the school displayed Stuyvesant as some kind of utopia, perfect in every way–except there is one catch–You had to meet all of their (insanely difficult) academic standards.

This idealization of Stuyvesant is interesting to me, because after a great deal of time there, no one who is or has been a student at that school is the happiest person I have ever met, my peers are usually some of the saddest. Stuy, is a stress fest all around, while the people are incredibly, intelligent and talented, their existence is forever a state of panic–uncertain as to what roads lie ahead. 

For every student at Stuy, this is not a tale, as commonplace as it may be, it is interesting to me, how parallel the experiences of the various students at the school are. And at the same time, how greatly varied the successes and stories within the school really are.

Seeing people readied to go off to college was soul‐crushing at times.
Remembering back on the freshman picnic and acceptance day when the first graders were screaming “I MADE IT! I’M GOING TO STUY!” made my heart sink a little.

When I was waiting to hear whether or not I’d gotten in, the thought that I could be one of those kids one day pushing aside the common objective of doing well on the SHSAT and focusing on having more GPA‐based extracurriculars and a respectable number of ECs made my blood boil.

However, even though I constantly have to complain about Stuyvesant and complain I surely do, I know I couldn’t go to a high school with any other girls.
I can’t imagine having to hear my friends complaining about clubs such as the cool kids do.

Going to Christmas Formal with a random guy I didn’t even know, trysting with him until the sun rose at 3 am in the lobby of that restaurant whose name I refuse to acknowledge, almost letting tears drip down my face as I hugged Mombo, falling for multiple sets of those grey eyes that said “You, Haley, yes you, how do you feel about sushi?” before throwing caution to the wind and moving on to the next crush.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.
Some people think Stuyvesant is a place of opportunity, a hub of the future, the breeding ground for a greater sense of understanding in both the world and self.
They tell you that graduating from such a school is an accomplishment, and that the troubles your time there will pose on your psyche shall be worth the wondrous things that you shall achieve.
Is this true? I’d assume so, were it not that this high school purports a mask of hypocrisy like nothing else.
It markets its wide range of clubs, that seek to promote nerdiness and uniqueness in its students, while at the same time forces them to work in rigorous classes and participate in hectic extracurriculars, eroding any sense of autonomy students have and burning them dangerously close to their fears of an impending nervous breakdown. 
The greatest deceits of them are the dire words of guidance counselors, who make you believe that you have at your disposal a solution to all your worries, a chance to meet your dreams and see the goals which you have worked to pursue for your entirety flared into fruition in a single breath.
You begin to believe them, and begin to fear their great wisdom. Then, your results are in. You learn that you have scored worse on the SAT, or received lower grades than you were hoping. You told your parents that you applied to this certain college, and what will they think when they realize you won’t get accepted?
And how can you live with the shame of this? Of becoming yet another statistic of Stuyvesant, one of the many failures of this school?
One day, you would like to fantasize, the hallowed halls of Stuyvesant will roar with praise for you. Yet, at the moment, all present grounds suggest that you were better off not attending in the first place.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.
The thought of coming, joining the likes of all of the fastest, most math and science oriented minds in the country, joining the average SAT scores of 2060, the SAT scores that just this March had reached the 37th percentile among the nation's SAT scores.
I had my hopes set high, having always been better than acceptable at the fast-paced math-focused lifestyle.

And yet, I had felt so much disappointment, having planned my own trajectory so fast with a high school which had at least statistical superiority over my two other fall-back choices, when things had gone differently from how I wished them to.
It may sound pretty agonizing and pathetic, but I'm a pretty emotional kid that grows pretty disappointed with the things that make him disappointed.
I did wish, with so much gusto, to be the top percentile.
But I guess working for the better faculty and getting a nice education just wouldn't happen this high school career.

I don't know, I'm definitely disappointed, but things aren't the way they were back in Elementary School and Junior High, when I was at the top notch of everything math and some science.
It took more than fitting like Poe's raven into a cuckcoo clock, as though I belonged in Middle School as soon as I was queued up to join in but my age held me back.

I don't know.
There isn't much strategy to making the best of a path that I definitely did not choose, but didn't leave according to chance either.
That isn't fair.
It spawns hostile and embittered people who wouldn't say that life isn't worth living, but say that living with the choices that others and life itself made for you is an outrage on yourself and all of humanity.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech. No, Stuyvesant hasn’t been the place where I learned about my family or my identity, or where I made close friends and branched out to explore my interests in various realms of life. Sure, I’ve learned some Computer Science, made some new friends at science Olympiad, done math club, controlled the scoreboard at the basketball games, shickranked during the basketball games and played dodgeball with/against Sigma Phi Lambda, but as for Stuvesant being an effervescent, bubbling cauldron of educational, social, and personal growth, I’m not so sure.


When thinking about applying to Stuyvesant, I don’t remember searching the name of the school on the internet and learning that Udo Von Ascheberg called the boys the most handsome in the city and the girls the most self conscious. I don’t remember checking reviews from current or past students and reading that due to the exclusion of most kids who didn’t receive full Asian citizenship upon immigration, the school was divided into separate groups of cliques. After I took my SHSAT and got a number that was considerably low in the Stuyvesant range, I was contacted by the “guidance counselor” of my school. She couldn’t contain her glee as she described how she had just been in contact with a parent who wasn’t planning on sending his child to Stuyvesant but changed his mind. “It’s going to be difficult to get in,” was all she had to say. It didn’t matter that I wanted to help people and make things better, like becoming a doctor or even a teacher. It didn’t matter that a lot of things about Stuyvesant seemed fishy, like it required the clothing of an Ivy-League school (a shirt with a collar) but according to the student handbook, only school shirts were to be worn. It didn’t matter that my best friend was going to Staten Island Tech. I tested for Stuyvesant because it had one of the highest graduation rates and I wanted that for my family.

And then nothing happened. I wrote an article for the Voice, had a blast with my friends, attended a science class or two, and even had time to play video games. Where was bio? Where was chem?
It was only the other day when a man ordered a pizza, mistaking two random new yorkers - the only types of people who could possibly rationalize $2.75 slices - for delivery people. Then the man, who later said he didn’t know what to say, couldn’t say another word. The truth is, even though you may be a criminal, chances are, you didn’t commit the crime. The truth is, even though Cloyd’s, Morano’s, Veniero’s, Bleecker Street Pizza… have their own fanatic followers, you can’t say that all of New York or even Manhattan likes their slice the same. Well unless of course you are the average Stuyvesant attendee. Even though, like the man who ordered pizza, you cannot say anything, you know you aren’t qualified. But, who’s really qualified to eat pizza?

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. When I was
younger, my father would tell me stories of his time here at Stuyvesant, building it up as
an Asian engineers' incubator, himself having later pursued a career in chemistry. When I first
took the Specialized High School Admissions Test, the energy toward receiving and inevitably
accepting an offer of admissions seemed endless, considering all I knew about the school at
that time, especially the part about it being a specialized high school.

When I arrived at the Stuyvesant building as an eight grader, however, I was led to understand
that not every student who attends this school is interested in that many STEM subjects,
and that I would adapt to, and fulfill the promise of attending this school for some of the other
things I had learned this school could offer. I began to appreciate the environment that had
evolved the building, with students forming many distinctive and unique cultures, only
being enri
ncihed by everyone's shared experiences of the new and exciting road that is high
school.

During my time at this school, I have gained many new perspectives on myself, as well
as the peers that I have befriended. I feel as though I have gained a better
understanding of myself as an individual as well as that of others' in my own position,
especially since I do consider this school to be very culture-packed, with people from
various backgrounds and neighborhoods. I think this has helped me to further acquaint
myself with the social interactions that many of us struggle with.

Having spent nearly eleven years of my life going to school, I've observed many of my peers
do not know really know of how to genuinely interact with other people, being specially
slighted toward people of their own same gender that would commonly be presumed by
someone of their age group as romantic interests. Fortunately, I think I've become much
better at that. I've also been through the entire 'high school' application process with my
peers, so I think having experienced such a rush and long-term process with students this
young has also helped me to become less nervous around new people, and to approach
applying to colleges in the future with less fear, just being able to have my applications
edited by them to get another idea of where I'm at in terms of applying to schools.

As a youth, I was told that going to a specialized high school is a difficult experience, one which is emotionally and physically taxing. Becoming a Stuyvesant student felt a lot like passing some invisible, real-life Trial of the Grueldark—when you eventually enter the school and survive long enough, you’re welcomed into an ancient and powerful community.

When I first came to Stuyvesant, I experienced an extreme openess. I went from a heterogeneous junior high to an institution in which academic excellence and rarely, if ever, called into question. One of Stuyvesant’s most charming qualities is its general meritocracy, allowing students with comparatively few resources just as many opportunities for success as those arriving with countless advantages, such as lengthy test prep or the WKCD set. For the most part, I’ve relied solely on education to get me through Stuyvesant and I’ve yet to be socially criticized for my shortcomings elsewhere. This idea of meritocracy extends beyond the classroom and permeates throughout Stuyvesant as a whole. 

In every way, I find myself in one of the few environments remaining where people are still graded holistically on the basis of their character. If attendance of an event is seen as the result of melding of free will and creativity, a meritocratic but highly aesthetic mindset understandably become prominent. Even outside of the community events, students are encouraged to enthusiastically participate during lunchtime. Selection of certain food trucks or implementation of certain club bylaws are dictated by passionate discourse. This is much to the chagrin of some, but I for one enjoy living in a truly diverse, student-driven environment. 

Alas, my experience at Stuyvesant cannot go without regarding the well-documented instances of intimidation. In extreme events, non-Stuyvesant individuals are beaten and robbed by rivals. I imagine the hostile actions are rooted in turf protection, but in my lifetime Stuyvesant residents are among the least likely to be victimized; even less so than middle-class Caucasians in Westchester. When I experience an attack, I feel compelled to protect my station as shared by my classmates, but in the current global environment I feel like an arbitrary nationalist. To be a Stuyvesant student is not to foster a bias rooted in nationalism, but to feel like a part of a diverse community which is rare for anyone living in 2016. 

I’ll never forget the feeling of being a part of this community. I hate to waste it by enabling a dangerous discourse propagating violence rooted in merely bureaucratic ideas tied to New York state’s zip code-based high school system. I hate to have negative outlooks on the ugly but misguided acts of Stuy-kids protecting themselves. 

But others in my classes are visibly terrified to become new members of Stuyvesant and that’s totally understandable. No matter your color, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, attention to detail (CTest again) or anything else polarizing, your experience of becoming a part of this timeless community is yours to determine. I’m so grateful to have accidentally coasted through Stuyvesant’s immensely stressful selection process, but since my admission, I’ve earned my place here. Being B110 has facilitated my experiences learning from the Stuyvesant alumni of generations past. You can call me a part of the student body, but we share allegiance to the Stuyvesant brand.

Island Tech. Stuyvesant has its good sides and its bad sides.

My freshman year. Since the first day of last September, I had felt lonely and lost.  But who wasn’t? There were strangers everywhere.
Now, don't get me wrong; some of these people are actually nice, but a vast majority of the bubbling sea of teenagers in the hallway
I found to be a) annoying, b) terrifying and c) nightmarish.

Sometimes the decisions the teachers made were so inexplicable that the only explanation was the fact that they were seemingly
psychotic lunatics.  For example, my ninth grade life science teachers placed so much emphasis on learning each and every
single molecule in the damn Krebs cycle, and by the time I found myself in the tenth grade taking a Biology Regents, not once
did my skills in knowing the different molecules come into play.

The work that sometimes the teachers assigned was frequently borderline ridiculous. For example, my teacher gave the class an assignment, who was based on taking a family picture and analyzing everyone who's in the picture and writing a paragraph or two describing the picture and everyone in it. Although I spent several paragraphs whining, only two were planning to discuss the assignment's topic, , and the rest of the entire homework (about five paragraphs or so) were full of complaints about how stupid and pointless the assignment was. The final product of was about two essays about my family and then another five paragraphs about how stupid I thought the assignment was. How creative of me.

It’s funny how now my freshman year seems like it’s so long ago and another lifetime away. Freshman year was extremely
difficult for me. I hadn't felt so horrified of a huge jarring change since I had been potty trained. Freshman year was my first time at Stuy and I felt extremely isolated. In many ways it felt worse then middle school. In many ways it felt better. I met some interesting people. Some of them I call some of my favorite people today. I had the time of freshmen year to immerse myself in both the environment of Stuyvesant, the special building on Chambers Street, strange classes with mysterious inanimate object-like names (UMAP, ILC), and the Stuy culture. 

During my first year at Stuyvesant, I learned to assert myself against my peers when I needed to. Of course, that doesn't mean any experience I had freshman year was a bad experience (The year wasn't all sunshine and rainbows from start to finish either). I learned how to balance my different classes and how to manage my time better in order to succeed in school. There were times that my prioritizing duties entailed the sacrifice my free time and hours of sleep. 

During my first year at Stuyvesant, I learned to interact with a variety of people and navigate through the diverse personalities in the school. There are many types of personalities I met in high school, such as "the arrogant Stuyvesant student too cool for every non-Stuyvesant student", the delusional overachiever  and "the naïve student in AP Physics who wholeheartedly believed the course is easy" (obviously, there are many more but none of them come to mind just yet). Well, there was this one girl who was my best best friend. That friendship fell into oblivion. We no longer spoke to each other because of an incident. (You’ll see if you read more.) It wasn’t just in the classroom. It's not just the Stuyvesant student I met. I met interesting people everywhere. The bank worker that never smiled, the woman at the gas station, my summer camp counselor. Funny that when you go somewhere new, you almost always encounter new people.

I can’t believe there’s just a week left in this school year. For me, though, I’ve had so much to cram in life, just in the last week alone, that it hasn’t entirely affected me.

All of the deadlines, all of the various tests, have me feeling like there isn’t really an end to this school year. For me, there is still work to do, no matter how my school year ends.

All the work that I’ve done this year has been for a purpose. However, with everything that I’ve done, it has felt like the fact that I’m attending this school is the sole reason why I’ve done it all.

This purpose is to get into college at the end of the school year – like so many do. I, unfortunately, in the eyes of some, don’t have a greater goal in mind – yet. In the eyes of others, I just believe that I’m rather limited in the options I have.

As part of my journey in becoming a “passenger” to this school, I’ve met great people. I attended the Stuyvesant Math Team, I’ve taken part in various clubs like the Computer Science Club, I partied with my friends all throughout high school.

These are only some of things I’ve done in my time in high school.

To the world, what was just an ideal bulleted list, has all begun to culminate, leading up to where I am to see, or have seen rather.

I believe that Stuyvesant, being it’s own school within the real world, relates to my life in more ways than one. I could even compare Stuyvesant to the “yearbook” metaphor, as it’s where I’ve met such memorable characters.

I would go on to state that, despite it’s appearance, the school is fake. But it rather can be considered a radically different universe in which there are many characters who could consider to be the same as me.

I’ve developed a new personality in the process. Perhaps it’s not important to one and all, but, for me, it’s rightfully so. This process has heavily impacted my identity; I wouldn’t be standing here if it hadn’t.

I can’t predict how my future will turn out. But nonetheless, I can always call back to this day and the last four years to remind me of the unprecedented changes I’ve gone through; I’m not done yet.

Unfortunately, now that I’ll be leaving this plot of land, with all its storied history, there’s gonna be a void in my life, a void where I believed these past four years were real. But, rather than diminish my joy in whatever comprises my experiences, this plot of land will still be in my mind.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s not all bad.

Yet, better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

“My happiness is so terrifying it seems just like homesickness.”

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.
In my introduction to this website, I'll cite this 
little quip:

"It's unfortunate that the greatest honor of 
Stuyvesant is only a ninety out of a hundred
on the easiest test in the world – the Specialized
High Schools' Exam."

It probably doesn't sound all that successful, 
huh? But when these admissions officers see 
we Stuyvesant kids walk with our heads held 
high, the respect will build up. Granted, it's 
not the respect we think we deserve, but 
we've worked freaking hard to get here, 
haven't we?

Just thinking of how far I've come makes me 
wanna write a paragraph talking about every 
aspect of highschool: social, academic, 
personal growth, and everything in between.

In fact, that's probably the best idea.

### Love and Identity

It's not a secret that Stuyvesant lacks 
on the social front, but it's not 
completely horrendous, either. Or maybe I've 
been blessed with good luck. Or maybe I'm 
unluckying sharing my social stories to a 
worldwide online prenium. Either way, 
there were two relationships I had before 
stuy: 

### Academics

10th grade was one of the worst academically.
9th was a breeze, with me having only some 
bullshit Geometry and Psychology AP.  
10th was a breeze in itself.

### Friends and support network

I can't stress how many times I've just 
hanging out, having a laugh with Moti, 
Ray, Dan, and Kelly. 

Can't stress how supportive my family has 
been, especially my beautiful mom who cooks
for me everyday. 

### Applications

I applied to absurd places and reached 
high as well. Sushi Fenwick and I sent out 
our applications on November 12th, 2017. 
We've been working on it all year, 
brainstorming ideas, honing our skills 
day in and day out, reminiscing upon missing 
out on Enders Game and Wandering iin the fourth 
grade for the sake of another essay

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

Having a disdain for mediocrity since elementary school and a lust for knowledge since middle school, I was always on the prowl for a place where I could learn and challenge myself, as defined by the standards of the day.

Since I was young, I regarded my education as one of the most important things shaping me as an individual. I was even known to take full responsibility for my education and to carry that responsibility with great pride.

Hyfe Elementary School exposed me to the world of the great thinkers, such as George Washington Carver, Neil Armstrong, and Marie Curie, among many others. Their lives captivated my imagination as much as the stories I heard from my parents did. 

I underestimated the importance of such community role models in urban environments at first – solely interested in being great in the household and initially holding no interest in community outside of the neighboring community. Still, I continued on my search for greatness; nothing would stand in the way of my desire for knowledge.

Looking back now, summer seemed so far away – lightyears of brief summer school sessions dedicated to teaching phonics interspersed with the customary “free” days (in reality, days allocated for field trips, extra hands-on activities, and P.E.). Sometimes, on those “free” days, my mother drove me to Boulevard Books, the nearest independent bookstore that wasn’t Barnes and Nobles, which was a scant five-minute drive away. Boulevard was stacked with endless rows of used books; the smell was one of the reasons I loved going there probably the most. I remember reading Bebop, Boom-Bop and Street Jazzed, Jazzman and many other “jazz” musicians and patterns. Although reading was subject to my mother’s will, it was nevertheless an addiction I fed day by day.
I determined that my chances of going to an “advanced” school might be few and far between, since most South Bronx families did not place primary emphasis on learning, but were more interested in the “cool” of not caring. This concept of coolness consisted of many things – ignoring life’s possibilities, ignoring the past, and fashioning yourself as one destined to imitate rather than innovate and to contribute less than expected or desired. My lust for greatness awoke me to recognize my neighborhood’s way of thinking was the opposite of that idea. I refused to be ‘cool’ in that sense of the term. Eventually, I became disillusioned by the anti-intellectual idea of ‘coolness’ – coolness, I would eventually come to see, emanating much more of an uncertainty with one’s own life and its ramifications than an actual affectation; people were born every day, and every day, many of them were born as products of “coolness’.

“… I want to be a great scientist,” I said to Mrs. Jameson, my teacher.  
“What, like Marie Curie?” she asked me quizzically.  
“Okay, I want to be a better astronomer than the Stephens,” I clarified. I’m not sure what that statement actually meant – to be better than them at all at astronomy when I was eleven? To perform experiments with them later, just as they had performed experiments independent of my knowledge at age ten in 1963? That sort of thing.  
“Yeah, that’s right!” she said, smile on her face. She was all too sentimental. For, she knew my brother, and usually she talked poorly about him, if in hushed, sympathetic tones. She said she knew of his death, but wouldn’t touch on that with me.  
“I hope you will become an astronomer!” She patted me on the shoulder, because she understood the weight of my ambition – ambition shared by other children in the neighborhood, yes, but ambition that would find itself thwarted by neighborhood circumstances. 

“Be careful, Michael. They can change you,” Mrs. Jameson told me one day in the course of a somewhat power-awesome parent-teacher conference, just before finish our meeting. I was pleased to have learned more about science in my four years at Hyfe: about bacteria, about the solar system, about natural selection and other things, such as in the library. Before middle school came up, I took an interest in the latest popular book franchise, Harry Potter. Harry’s adventures transported readers to a world full of experience, knowledge, love, and exploration – my own, who knew?

I have to put myself, with caution, into any conversation involving me saying I valued intelligence and education because I, who barely made it into Stuyvesant and certainly have not stood out among any of my peers, worked hard to get here, to say the least. I have to put myself out there and declare the truth to everyone. Before anything else, though, I have to take pride in my own uniqueness and my own value to everyone else around me - I want to thank my Grandfather for being my teacher, my brother for being there for me through my childhood, Hubert and Kamil for being there for me. I want to thank Anthony and Joel for driving me and bringing me in for my interview. I want to thank all my teachers and family for shaping me into the person I am.Most importantly, I want to thank myself for keeping true to who I am through my progress at Stuyvesant High School. 
It’s Grade 12 and I can recall the line which for the first time signaled to me that education was worth my effort and sweat and blood – “…I hope you will become an astronomer!” The general knowledge that neighborkids generally hold of astronomy is limited, to say the least; they don’t get it, they think they do, they wish they did, they dream they do. Right now, neighborhood social conditioning will most likely smother the talents of those who simultaneously can’t take their parental differences seriously and who don’t have any family involved in their daily lives. I’m lucky to have parents who can balance prejudice and love. Other students are not so lucky - many of them have to endure broken homes; many are faced with domestic violence, sexual abuse, and institutional abuse (carried out by a multitude of sources: national, local, and even individual).

It’s Grade 12 and now I can recall the workings of Mrs. Jameson and Mr. Poggi’s classrooms and their propensity to teach every subject with its own level of respect and meaning. Mrs. Jameson and Mr. Poggi dedicated themselves to getting into both the history and science of their professions in order to teach discerningly and to reach out to their students as a missionary would, however misguided these missions were. Since that time, I have gone through rigorous schooling, motivating myself with forethought and fear for the most ambitious I knew since the Columbine High School massacre. My hands, once dirty from aspiring to be astronaut, are now filthy from the stress of struggling to excel, from the guilt of wasting my high school years away, from the anxiety that I may be dropping the ball.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

Stuyvesant isn't as hard as people say it is. It’s extremely predicable and easy to succeed in. The students are extremely hard-working and weary. Usually around junior year, you start prioritizing AP-approved activities and future college admissions to the extent that you start to feel like you’re not even a person anymore, just a resume with a GPA post-fixed to it and whatever large project your supervisor tells you to undertake.

One time I was sitting at a restaurant with my mom, apparently complaining about all the homework I had. I don’t really remember all that other people in my school are saying, just what I told her – about a project for Euro Regents history. What happened was I told her about my homework, and that I couldn’t stay at Stuy – and she nodded. She didn’t ask questions, or push me, or ask why I hated it so much, she just listened. I don’t think she realized how disappointed I was by the school – how it had emotionally impacted me enough to consider switching to a school where there I wouldn’t be getting the same intensive preparation, where I would be taking fewer Advanced Placement classes and where I wouldn’t be viewed as “excellent potential,” but just a student, with no star next to my name to show priority in selection. 

A few months before I told her this, I was whining to my friends about how I hated Stuyvesant so much that I was tempted to transfer.

What I said when I frequently expressed these feelings to people was: “What does [APUSH teacher] think he’s doing, teaching multiple periods of APUSH and AP Euro history to get kids college credit. Who does he think he is?”

And then responded, “Everyone I know from [different high school] is a better writer than me despite not taking AP Language any time soon.”

I had spent the past 2 years in a dream, stumbling across different playgrounds with the selected few elites. This new school, they were streetwise. They knew how to dress, how to talk, how to be successful. They were just halfway through high school in their scheduled 4 years and already they were making connections, figuring out how to work their way up via the same things I was so focused on doing, except they weren't giving themselves a nervous breakdown by taking stress to the next level by getting into the very best high school in New York State. 

But maybe this is just because of my personal problems and not because of the school itself. I can’t tell what’s part school spirit and what’s just because I don’t really belong here. I should probably stop thinking about having more intelligence than everybody. I’m here inside a population bubble – the almost problematic need for diversity on a schoolwide level means that a good amount of the more traditionally educated students of Indian and East Asian descent have greater motivation and a more urging need to excel and go to the best college possible. I can say this because it’s common knowledge that a certain number of seats that are reserved for students of color – students in New York City are offered priority based on test scores and their parents' income, with some seats reserved for children of alumni and G9-12, a form of the Internet forum. The difference is I know it and I’m sitting here feeling miserable because I’m not making it to nationals. And no, it doesn’t help that my psat class got cancelled because Principal Jim Matteo didn’t know anything about the pset class, despite knowing that it involves the psat. But then again, that’s our savior, our protector, the principal who really cares. If the school wants you, they’ll hunt you down and stop at nothing to have you, but once you’re pulled in, you’re powerless and no one will help you – not the curriculum needs to be adjusted, because some people are getting their hands on published tests and sharing it with their friends; no one wants to rule on the privacy of the test-takers because of course, it’s for the benefit of others, that is, people just like you, who are pulling upwards of 80-hour workweeks.

I don’t know why they force you to put down 3-2 if your class has 15 periods. 5-2-2? 8-2. 2-1-3 is appropriate if you’re in both poly and bio, but what if you’re not ambitious enough to take both poly and bio and you’re just taking 3 math classes, which is clearly the smart decision for the majority of people who would survive the pressure. I don’t even know if that suggestion counts as a cherry because of its rarity to such a formulaic userbase. If you’re not currently taking calc 3 and if you're taking intro to cs in a computer science class, keep lying that you’re in 2 credits of Chinese so you can get some sleep.

I’m sure you see where this is going – if you’re doing 3 math classes, which is just enough to get the most out of your subscription to the New York Times, you’d be insane to continue doing it indefinitely. You’re a zombie. You were probably sleepwalking through your ELA and history class, at least until you got the chance to go to the museum on Friday. I bet you took the time out at a neighborhood hotspot to buy some ludicrous supplement to your diet plan a few days ago online. I know you didn’t have time to eat your lunch. What a horrible environment, filled with liars and cheaters and people who are too exhausted to be outed for being copyers and soundfiles because the school is sanctified and faculty sucks because a lot of other kids hurt more than you and have it worse, this is so unfair that when people skip the classes you’re in the actual class, you might as well go home and take a break. Have some tea for once. 

I don’t know why I kept all of this phone numbers in my address book, to be honest all of these people I barely received texts from. I’m not joking. The city sucked anyway and my phone was too expensive. But, are you listening? I didn’t even get the chance to finish my homework, because I spent all of my free time changing clothes and talking to my friends at home, till 2 am, when I’d force myself into forcing myself to sleep or study by convincing myself that I needed to watch that little television show before the final. (That works? Yeah sure, if you don’t do it you’ll be wasting time.)

I think I should take some time off to really think about what I’m doing here, because honestly, too many people went too far. Eventually, I think, this disparity would lead to resentment in a person, hate, and ice. But, I guess, that’s a sacrifice you have to make because, ya know, you like the people around you, you share memories and experiences with them, and you can get helpful help by working towards the same end goal.

I definitely think that next year should be much better than this year in terms of happiness, ease of mind, and mental stability. School-work – there’s much more of it, and it’s light years harder. You will probably divide yourself, as many students do, between your busy schedule, that is, work and homework and your social life, one that may or may not include your friends, who actually, to be honest, mean the world to you at this school because the system is actually, kind of, flawed and there is not a lot of room to talk about your life and your reasons for being stressed and upset and angry, because you will be told that amount of stress is insignificant and that it would be for the best for you to fix it in solve it yourself and maybe, afterwards, in your senior year you’ll be completely fine this time because that’s what your parents and teachers have been telling you throughout your entire life and the worst case scenario isn’t that bad, and whatever.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech. Ever since I found out that I do well academically and was in range of the rigorous Stuyvesant High School, I have always dreamt of going to a place better than the average high school. I wanted more from my high school career than teens who fought among themselves and did not fully experience the social and academic parts of school. I wanted my teachers to care for my learning, yet still push me to my limits. I wanted to fully appreciate the academics taught in my classes. But ever since I stepped into the building for the first time, I have found that Stuyvesant is not all it’s hyped up to be.

As with any city high school, Stuyvesant has its cliques. Often, they make up the social hierarchy of the school. Everyone wants to be accepted and make sure they do not fall behind in the competition. It’s as if we compete over every aspect of our lives, especially at this school. This makes me question what they were looking for when they opted to change the test so that only half the number of students who used to get in could now get in. Did they want to jump start their superior race or did they want all of their competition to be equally cut, so that there was no longer tension in the hallways and stairwells of the building. From what I’ve heard from teachers, the days before just about everyone who came was let into the school, the environment was like a bubbling cauldron of anger and anxiousness – waiting to spill into the classrooms and college readiness. 

After being let in to Stuyvesant and having the time to calm down, students question their sanity and the ability to keep up with the stress that comes with this school. Students start to crack under the pressure and seek ways to get ahead of their classmates. So some students would then lie, cheat and steal their way to that fresh, crisp diploma at graduation. But afterwards, all of that and the negative reputation that comes with it is smudged and messed up as they walk out of the building with the satisfaction of a 12-year-long battle with the school. Speaking of graduation, it seems that throughout the entire 4 years at this school, students push and give their all to win the race against time – to apply to colleges at the best time; when all of their peers have procrastinated and are writing their essays and filling out their rapidly changing “dream schools” list. But I do not want to lie and say that my experiences at this school have all been bad. While these definitely make the school less than perfect and even far from the dreams that I had before getting admitted, I have met so many people and made so many memories.

Ever since the days of hunting dragons and ninjas in the hallways, I have developed friendships which will longer than the satisfaction of graduating: they were meant to last a lifetime. Throughout the years we have been in this school, our roller coasters of emotions have been enhanced by being next to the supportive and loveable people in our lives – whether they be in the form of parents, friends or lovers.

"SAT scores? Check. ELA score? Check. Math score? Check. Science score? Check." I reminded myself repeatedly what I already knew to be true: I had passed the test. All the hard work and sweat I put into studying for these tests had finally paid off. I was then informed that I was the smart kid in my 5th grade class. That never happened before. Kids usually didn't look at the Asian girl with a bad haircut and glasses in the corner of the room. But when admissions of the specialized high schools in NYC came around, they had  to come face to face with the facts: no matter what, I had beaten them when it mattered. I was to be admitted to Stuyvesant High School.

I then reflected upon how it came to be. My parents were never home, being busy with their own jobs. My mother an accountant, my father a Spanish interpreter, it always felt like I was seeing them in church only. So I felt compelled to make up for lost time-- if i wanted time with them, I had to make myself something to be proud of. I began to work hard on scoring high on any test I could find. The countless hours spent testing, studying and the like finally paid off. I had finally done something right. It wasn't that I didn't TRY to perform academically-- I very much did-- but I could never seem to get past the 85% mark. I always got a B on the report card. And I hated it. I felt as if I was disappointing everyone who expected much more from me. But now, I felt as if I had a way to give back, to show that I was special, worth believing in.

My first year at this school was one filled with many trials-- mostly physical and semi-emotional. I struggled with tearing my nails to the point of bleeding and my wrist constantly feeling sore from repetition. I would wake up not wanting to strain myself, as if work were a virus and my body were the host trying to answer my weary distaste for every subject. I didn't enjoy walking to the third floor, succeeding in subjects I despised, discovering that whatever repressed me remained in my head. I worked hard arguing with my teachers on subjects that I knew no one else contradicted and therefore I was right.

Time went on. I argued that I wanted to take a foreign language, preferably Spanish, as I was fluent in the language, but was settled with French. I enjoyed that class-- until my teacher decided it would be best to have me clean the floor and arrange chairs while everybody else conversed using their new vocabulary, which I heard constantly. I felt it wasn't necessary. I had a teacher or two who decided to push me back, kick me down. I had teachers who wanted to take my grades down simply because they saw "a brown face in class", as I was constantly told by a fellow peer. I was called disrespectful by one, unreasonable by the other. I knew that I didn't want to subject myself to the pressure, the stress. Teachers thought I was trying to fight with them, often leading them to send me to the dean and give both of us an occupation as we both doodled and drew. I learned that teachers and I didn't play well together. To them, my grades and future were constantly at risk, being uprooted by my conduct and my apathy for what they were teaching. They saw a student who didn't want to raise her hands, who wanted to stay comfortable rather than uncomfortable. I saw a child one could simply say "just leave it alone". My stance was that I would get through the class, and that meant I was going to be left alone.

I don't remember a time where I was told I was wrong. I was wrong. But that doesn't matter now. Stuyvesant offered me a plethora of opportunities. Opportunities opened my mind to new possibilities, sticking to my sense of discovery and my drive to strive. Sure, I found myself crying during homeroom after my parents had announced divorce. Or finding my crushes switching sexuality to the boy on my anatomy table. I feared that I would be the cause for cracking the SAT bubble created for us at school. I hacked those. I saw my friends going to hospitals when I couldn't call or text them back. But I worked with their enthusiasm, knowing that even though I wasn't cheating from them, I had to somehow be like them to find such energy and motivation.

Life has taught us that things don't go our way. That even when we lay down on sofas with Netflix blaring and SodaStraw hat going weak, we're seeing how things seem. Things seem. It never means that they are. Each and every day, Stuyvesant offered me a new challenge, a new adventure, a new lifes lesson that I took perhaps in the best of my ability. I became fearless. Now, I am the definition of "aesthetic". I am always a cliche.

In the end, Stuyvesant saved me in more than just one way. I could be maybe writing this in a different school. Maybe this is my imagination working at its best, but it's a thing worth believing. You must be cognizant of any pain, hurt or lack of motivation in your life, but don't pick them up. Just walk away. Stuyvesant offered me a chance to prosper, to enjoy life and deliver a lasting legacy of not just something I thought would be worth mentioning, but anything I'd think more fondly of. Life changed for me in multiple ways, whether it be on the outside or on the inside. I was merely a cliche to some, changed to many, added to little and sought after by even less. I am still myself. That doesn't matter. But what has shaped me is the nature of worrk. The nature of freedom in choosing my career, my life path and finding comfort in something else than popular culture. I am free to be anything I want. And that is why mentioning this in this manner is easy. Because in the end, school doesn't define you. Your experiences, your challenges and your willingness to face them head on-- now, that's what defines you.

Funny thing, isn't it? In the end, Stuyvesant saved me. Don't believe the hype. It's all about the work you put in, not the name you make for that work.
