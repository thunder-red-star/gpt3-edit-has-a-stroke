My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

I remember hearing about Stuyvesant High School when I was a young middle schooler.
I knew that it was the most prestigious, prestigious high school in New York.
While my friends were scrounging around the freshman high school fair, I walked straight
to the Stuyvesant High School booth. There, a cute, poofy-haired young man with a face so
white he looked unwholesome was helping attendees acquire information pamphlets. I asked 
him how I could, one day, become a student of Stuyvesant, a role model for middle schoolers
everywhere. He took my right hand in his left and looked straight into my eyes.
"The future is an open book with an unknown number of empty pages," I thought he said.
"Yessss, delicious," I replied.
"What was that?" I then heard him ask.
"I said, 'Yes, delicious.' What did you say?" I inquired.
He rolled his eyes. "Just study hard and get lucky, kid. It's a popularity contest," and
released one of my fingers to perform some other task I was unaware of, because I had turned
around and walked away in a huff.

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.

I remember staring at the school newspaper “The Spectator” as a 8th Grader in middle school
and admiring the bright lights of the city that were featured outside the classrooms on certain days.
I thought it was amazing how students could go through rigorous
courses while still finding a way to write articles and put together
high level media.
Little did I know that regular students also suffered through the
stress of the school just as much as I did; it was just that they found
a way to relieve it in a more productive manner.

High school is a bittersweet experience. In other words, there are some experiences which you do not wish to relive and
enjoy. I had heard that Stuyvesant High School was one of theoretically the best schools in New York, even the states.
My first experiences with the school system in New York was a disaster, since in the sixth grade, I had broken my
right leg from attempting to qualify for the Achilles Track Club. I had to miss a significant amount of time due to
the hospitalization, and so, I failed my sixth grade year, pushing me past my age at the time. Nonetheless, I attended
the Track Club, and was quite happy to do so.

One day, I thought to myself, "Wouldn't it be nice to attend one of New York's best high schools?" And so, I did the
programs, learned the tricks that were required in the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT). And eventually,
I was admitted to a school that I had only heard of. Welcome to Stuyvesant.

My freshman year, I felt like I was on top of the world. I was finally in Stuyvesant, the top public high school in New York City.

My PSAT score of 1954 had just been mailed home in a decorative envelope, stamped with a seal of approval from the College Board, stating that I was eligible for Commended recognition in recognition of my outstanding performance on the PSAT.

I was taking four AP classes: AP US History, AP English Language, AP Calculus BC, and AP Physics C. I'd had enough AP experience in middle school to feel confident passing them all.

I might have felt that feat envy towards the kids in my class taking 5 AP classes, but in my mind, increasing the academic rigor of classes by taking an additional AP class led to a net decrease in the amount one learned per unit of time. The stress would skyrocket, and test scores, which were the final culmination of learning for them, would plummet.

Or so I thought.

My sophomore year, I realized that I had little to actually boast about from my freshman year. 

My time at Stuyvesant High School hasn’t been all that it’s hyped up to be. But it’s better than going to Bronx Science or Staten Island Tech.
